on foot by James I, and had been renewed by Buckingham. Those powers
regarded the breach between England and France as a misfortune, which
they must endeavour to obviate if they would carry on the war against
Austria and Spain with full vigour. The Republic of Venice, which felt
itself most seriously threatened by these powers, made a great point of
promoting a reconciliation between France and England by the agency of
its ambassadors.</p>

<p>A few days before his unhappy end, Buckingham withdrew with the
Venetian ambassador, Aluise Contarini, into a retired chamber in one of
his country-houses, and there concerted with him a letter of pacific
import to his brother envoy in France, for him to communicate to the
French court<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. While Buckingham was preparing to strike a blow, he
still hoped to procure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span> from France tolerable
conditions for the besieged town of Rochelle. All other difficulties he
thought might then be removed in a couple of hours.</p>

<p>But Buckingham was assassinated. When the Venetians after this event
brought their negotiations before the King, who as yet knew nothing
about them, he even refused to hear them. He quite recognised the
necessity of finding some arrangement: ‘I acknowledge all that,’ he
said one day to the ambassador; ‘but,’ he added, ‘I have arms in
my hands, not to negotiate, but to save the town. My honour is at
stake<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.’</p>

<p>Though Rochelle, as we have seen, failed to hold out, the result cannot
be ascribed to King Charles. After Lindsay’s attempt to break through
the mole had proved unsuccessful—we do not quite know whether on
account of the superiority of the French, or from the above-mentioned
deficiencies on the side of the English—Charles I gave orders to renew
the attempt again, without any regard to the danger to his ships, and
not to retire from the town whatever might be the cost<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. On this
the council of war had in fact resolved to lead the ships against the
palisades by a way hitherto untried, when the town, despairing of help
and overpowered by unendurable hardships, capitulated.</p>

<p>After the fall of Rochelle the Venetians resumed their attempts at
mediation with redoubled ardour. King Charles was brought into a
more favourable frame of mind by the tolerable conditions granted to
the town in regard to the profession of religion, and by the evident
impossibility of doing anything effectual in France: and Contarini now
found him inclined to listen. But the ambassador was considerate enough
not to urge the King, after he had been beaten in the strife, now to
make overtures for its adjustment<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>: the negotiations were left more
than ever in the hands of the Venetian ambassador in France, Zorzo
Zorzi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span>

<p>They were principally concerned with two points. The French demanded
above all the execution of the provisions laid down in the marriage
contract for the constitution of the Queen’s household. Charles I not
only refused to revert to these, he even rejected the conditions which
he had consented to when Bassompierre was in England, and which the
French at that time did not accept. He insisted that her court should
continue as it was. He had made other arrangements for filling the
offices in the household;—how could he take away their places again
from the English lords and ladies who were in possession of them? He
would not have any misunderstandings at his court, in his house, and
as he said plainly, in his marriage bed. The Venetian ambassador in
England remarked that it would be disadvantageous to the Queen if these
demands were persisted in. And she herself also had already begged
that they should be dropped, on the ground that she was satisfied with
the present arrangements of her court: she did not even think fit to
write about them to her mother<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. However disagreeable it might be for
the Queen-mother herself, and for the zealous advocates of the Church
about her, her son and Cardinal Richelieu sympathised with the point
of view of Charles I, or else they saw that he would not give it up:
at all events they contented themselves with stipulating that, if an
alteration in the court were necessary, they should come to an amicable
arrangement on the subject, to suit the requirements of the Queen’s
service<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Even these words were merely accepted by the English in
the avowed expectation that they would never be used to disturb the
repose of the kingdom, or the mode of life of the King<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. In brief,
the execution of the former stipulations was given up by the French. In
this matter, which most nearly concerned King Charles, he carried the
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span>

<p>The second point affected the old connexion between the English and the
Huguenots. The former had hitherto claimed to regulate through their
intervention, and to fix by compact, the relations between the French
government and the Reformed Churches. Buckingham had already been
disposed to drop this claim: and after the last turn which affairs had
taken, there could be no more thought of maintaining it. The English
plenipotentiaries were satisfied with a general pardon bestowed on the
Huguenots by the King of France, reserving to them their Protestant
worship. But the English had wished that it should be indicated, if
even by the slightest expressions, that this concession was the effect
of the peace<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Not that it should be a condition of the agreement,
nor even that any interest in the result should be ascribed to England,
but something was to be said about regard for peace as the foremost
public good, and about the joint action between the two nations which
was in immediate prospect. They thought that this was demanded by their
honour, and they would not at once renounce all common feeling with
the Calvinists. But the French returned a decided refusal. True as it
was that the concessions that were vouchsafed to the Huguenots were
based on the necessity of a closer connexion with England and Holland,
which but for these could not have been agreed on, yet the French would
not allow any hint of this to be dropped. They would have feared that
occasion might thus be given for interference at some future time:
in any case the authority of the government would have been damaged.
The Venetian ambassador in London makes a merit of inducing Charles I
finally to desist from this request. The principal reason alleged by
him in support of his advice was that not only a question of religion,
but an actual rebellion was here concerned, inasmuch as the Huguenots
had leagued with Spain<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus was this peace concluded at Susa, April 1, 1629. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1629.</span> estimating the historical relations of the two kingdoms
in general, great importance must be assigned to it. What had been
brought about in the times of the Normans and Plantagenets, and once
more during the great wars of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries—I
mean a most intimate connexion of French and English interest—had, as
it were, repeated itself, although on a far smaller scale, during the
religious wars. In the times of Queen Elizabeth and James I the French
Reformed ranged themselves under the influence of England: even in the
time of Charles I this had not ceased. On the other hand the French had
sought to establish a counteracting influence on their side, especially
by the late marriage contract. Neither of the two governments profited
by this. In the peace of Susa they agreed to desist from this mutual
action on one another. The French resigned the literal fulfilment of
the marriage contract: the English renounced the connexion with the
Huguenots which had hitherto been acknowledged. Relations into which
religion entered could not be avoided, but the political sting, so to
speak, was taken out of them. In France from that date the ascendancy
of Catholicism could more decidedly be erected into a principle of the
state: in England the court once more asserted its Protestant character.</p>

<p>For the moment the result of the peace was to untie the hands of France
for the conflict with Spain. Every one knows what vast dimensions this
assumed: it set fresh enmity between the parts of the world of that day
which it rent asunder, and laid the foundation of the state of affairs
which prevailed in the following epoch.</p>

<p>While France carried her arms into Italy, in order to force back the
Spanish influence there, the King of England was to direct his forces
to North Germany, in order to check the spreading power of the Emperor
and the League. Maritime affairs at that time principally attracted the
general attention. Wallenstein advanced a claim to sovereignty over
the Baltic, but at the same time he intended to hold the ports of the
German Ocean and the mouth of the Elbe in behalf of the Empire: and a
combination between the Hanseatic shipping and the Spanish naval power
was contemplated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span> Roused by this unexpected
danger, the Kings of Sweden and Denmark held a conference in February
1629 on the confines of the province of Halland, and united to defend
the ‘Regalia of the northern crowns on the Baltic sea<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.’ The Danish
ambassador exerted himself most zealously to kindle the sympathies
of the Dutch and English also. And in fact the King of England, in
transmitting the official notification of the peace with France,
announced to the States-General that he had sent a squadron under
Pennington and Colonel Mackay to the Elbe in order to encourage the
King of Denmark<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and he invited the Dutch likewise to support him.
A short time before, Colonel Morgan with another considerable body of
troops, among whom were newly enlisted French and Scots, had started
from the islands of Sylt and Föhr and made an attack upon the troops
of the Empire and of Gottorp at Nordstrand. But at this moment, when a
new coalition embracing the South, West, and North of Europe, was again
just about to be formed to check the advance of the house of Austria,
Denmark, which was to have been supported in the first instance, came
to an agreement with that power. In the beginning of June, at Lübeck,
King Christian IV renounced his operations against the German empire;
but in return he received back without loss of a foot of land his
possessions in Holstein and Jutland, the greater part of which was in
the hands of the enemy. If we ask what induced the Imperialists to make
so extensive a concession, it was no doubt anxiety about that maritime
coalition, for which great exertions were being made at Copenhagen.
Even without this aid the Danish fleet was able to defend itself with
much more success than the army: the Imperial and German navies,
with all their combined force, were still far from being a match
for it. The generals were afraid of reverses, and of a mischievous
action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span> of the Danish fleet upon the coast
towns of which they had taken possession, and upon the German empire
in general<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Charles I had just sent one of his ablest and most
zealous diplomatists, Thomas Roe, a particular friend of his sister
the Electress Palatine, to Hamburg, in order to bring about a northern
alliance between the two kings, the Republic, and the Hanse towns<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.
He hoped still to delay the ratification of the treaty between Denmark
and Austria, and to make it abortive. But all was in vain; the peace
was far too advantageous to Denmark for the Danish councillors to give
it up again.</p>

<p>Upon this most of the adversaries of Austria and Spain, even those in
Italy, directed their gaze to the King of Sweden. The forces of the
Emperor, which were no longer engaged with Denmark, were now twice as
dangerous to him, and he appeared quite ready to take up arms if he
should be supported by France and England. Cardinal Richelieu showed
an inclination, if England would send a fleet to sea against Spain, to
furnish a third of the vessels, and to make common cause in general
with that power: he only wished that the undertaking should be carried
out in the name of England. But the withdrawal of Denmark had quite a
different effect upon the King of England, to whom the preservation
of his uncle had supplied a motive for taking arms: he inclined on
the contrary to follow the example set him by that prince. The Lord
Treasurer Weston, who had to provide the money, looked upon the Danish
peace as a relief: he breathed more freely when it had been concluded;
for after the unhappy results of the last Parliament the want of money
was so sorely felt by the government, that no one reckoned upon their
fulfilling their engagements, and they themselves would undertake none.
And such great injury had been inflicted on trade by the war, that the
whole people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span> cried out not only for peace with
France, but also, just as loudly, for peace with Spain<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Peter Paul Rubens, the painter, arrived in
London bearing proposals from the court of Spain. The painter was
also a clever diplomatist; his art served to cloak his missions. Two
years before he had had an interview with Balthasar Gerbier, a skilful
miniature painter, also a native of Antwerp, who had been employed
by Buckingham on secret business: they had conferred at Delft in
July 1627 on the establishment of peace between England and Spain.
Rubens belonged to the court of the Infanta Isabella, and had made
communications to her on the subject, but was reluctant to send his
papers to Spain<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; and besides, no one, he said, would have been
able to extract information from them. He was therefore summoned to
Spain in person, and was sent to England charged with overtures of
peace on the basis of the plans sketched out. Extremely remarkable were
the overtures which Rubens made. Although the estrangement between
England and Spain had grown out of the affair of the Palatinate,
Rubens made no attempt to settle this: he declared, on the contrary,
that it was not in the power of Philip IV to restore the Palatinate
to its former owner; that he would gladly set about it, but that it
was dependent mainly on the Emperor and the Elector of Bavaria. Rubens
however saw in this disagreement no absolute hindrance to the renewal
of friendly relations, especially in regard to commerce, nor to the
return of the ambassador of either power to the court of the other:
he thought that the two governments must only abstain from framing
new articles, and revert to the peace which King James had concluded
with Spain at the very beginning of his reign, and which left several
important controversies unsettled; that in the same way at this time
the affair of the Elector Palatine, and even of the Dutch, might remain
untouched;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span> that Charles I need not give up
either the one or the other, and yet might maintain peace with the
Spaniards<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. From our knowledge of this prince, these proposals,
especially after the conclusion of the Danish peace, must have been
most welcome to him. He also had now a freer prospect. Almost at the
first moment when the arrival of the French ambassador was talked of
in the Queen’s presence, he had said to her that in the course of the
year she might see the arrival of another from Spain. She answered, for
she was not yet of his opinion, that he must only take care that no one
deceived him afresh.</p>

<p>The world was already prepared for negotiations with Spain. The
Venetians had so zealously promoted the arrangement with France,
principally in order to anticipate them. People saw those persons again
appear at court who were thought to favour Spain, and had been obliged
to retire when Buckingham’s ascendancy was established. To men’s
astonishment, Lord Bristol, once the great antagonist of Buckingham,
now on the contrary himself acquired influence over the King. The Earl
of Arundel, of the house of Howard, resumed his former place in the
Privy Council. Closely allied with these men was the Lord Treasurer
Weston, who principally exerted himself to save money with the object
of relieving the King from the necessity of reassembling Parliament:
it was owing to him that dissensions at home furnished a real motive
for peace abroad. Weston himself, and Cottington, who was regarded
as a staunch adherent of Spain, and who professed Catholicism with
hardly any disguise, were selected to confer with Rubens; and that
to the exclusion of the other members of the Privy Council, even of
the Secretaries of State. Before the end of July they had made such
progress that the matter could be laid before the Privy Council<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.
The King loved to sit in council: but on important questions he
expressed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1630.</span> opinion so decidedly, that no
one ventured to contradict him. Thus on the present occasion also he
gave Weston’s scheme his unqualified approval. Cottington, much to
the annoyance of the French, set out for Spain: while on the part of
Spain, Don Carlos Coloma, one of the Infanta Isabella’s most trusty
ministers—for a subordinate would not have been thought of—was
appointed ambassador in England. Coloma was an old friend of Weston;
and it is supposed that the basis of an agreement had been concerted
between them beforehand<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>In the negotiations however the question of the Palatinate presented
a great obstacle; for King Charles and his ministers sometimes seemed
unwilling to come to a conclusion unless the Spaniards undertook a
formal obligation with regard to it. But the latter rejected conditions
by which they would very likely have even been compelled to go to
war with Austria and the Elector of Bavaria, and that at a time when
peace had not been concluded between Spain and France<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Looking to
the existing state of affairs in Europe, they refused to give up the
fortresses that were so extremely important strategically, and which in
that case might easily have fallen into the hands of others who were
hostile to them. They adhered to a view of the situation fundamentally
the same as that which had moved the King to break with them in the
first years of his reign. But the lofty courage of that period had now
abandoned him: he now dispensed with a stipulation like that which he
had then demanded, and contented himself with a simple promise that
satisfaction would be given him in the affair of the Palatinate. At
the signature of the peace, an assurance of Philip IV on this subject,
written with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1630.</span> own hand, was solemnly
delivered to him by Don Carlos Coloma<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>And already there were indications that the Spanish influence might
possibly this time produce more effect on the Emperor than before.
The Emperor allowed a plenipotentiary from the Elector, whom he had
laid under the ban, to appear at Ratisbon; and he showed a disposition
to withdraw the ban and to allow the expelled sovereign an income
out of the revenues of the country. Notwithstanding these offers the
restoration of his territory was still very far off. Charles said to
his sister, the Queen of Bohemia, that the agreement was a remedy which
could do no harm, even if it did no good; that he acquired thereby
a right to the co-operation of the King of Spain; that moreover he
was taking steps to conclude a defensive and offensive league with
France and the States-General for the restoration of the Palatinate,
but that unhappily he did not find these powers so willing as he had
expected<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. We know from Queen Elizabeth’s letters that she was
calmed by these assurances<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>The States-General had again rejected the proposals of the Spaniards
for a peaceful arrangement, which in themselves were not acceptable;
for they feared to endanger their existing government. The treaty of
1630 therefore caused them certainly not less uneasiness than that of
1604 had done. Charles I repeated to them assurances similar to those
which were then made, that his alliance with them, as far as their
state and religion were concerned, should not be prejudiced on that
account.</p>

<p>It was the wish of Charles I to revert to the policy of his father.
Experience had taught him that he could no longer advance in the path
on which he had entered while still Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1630.</span> of
Wales, and which he had continued to follow after he became King. He
had plunged himself into the gravest political embarrassments; and,
although the hostility between Crown and Parliament had long been
threatening, he had caused the first open outbreak. He now wished to
establish tolerably good relations with both the two neighbouring
powers alike. With France he felt himself more intimately connected in
the great affairs of Europe, and he took good care not to loosen this
tie: he did not drop the cause of the Elector Palatine; but he wished
at the same time to open commercial intercourse between his country
and the extensive and wealthy provinces of the Spanish monarchy. When
Cottington returned home from his embassy, he had the silver brought
by the ship in which he came laid upon wagons, and carried in a sort
of procession through the town. For he intended the inhabitants to be
impressed by the opulence of the country, the commerce of which was
reopened to them by the treaty just concluded.</p>

<p>Charles I shrank from bringing his whole strength to bear upon the
great questions of religion and politics which engrossed the continent,
that he might above all be the King of Great Britain. We may certainly
ask whether he was morally entitled to renounce his connexion with
European affairs after he had contributed so largely to increase the
existing confusion, and to bring the Protestant cause to destruction.
And moreover such a severance was hardly possible any longer. Religious
and political sympathies and conflicting tendencies had become so
strong on the continent of Europe, that in one form or another they
could not fail to react upon Great Britain as well.</p>

<span class="small">SHARE OF ENGLAND IN THE EVENTS OF THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR, 1630-1636.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Charles I had told his sister that the conclusion of peace with Spain
did not hinder him from forming an alliance with Sweden. And in
fact, in the summer of 1630, as soon as Gustavus Adolphus appeared
in Germany, we find one of the principal nobles of Scotland, James
Marquess of Hamilton, collecting English and Scottish levies with the
support of the King, who handed over to him the proceeds of a Scottish
tax for that purpose. One part of this force embarked at Leith, the
other at Yarmouth; and towards the end of July 1631 they landed at
Usedom, as Gustavus Adolphus had done a year before. The English have
always affirmed that the arrival of Hamilton with a considerable body
of troops contributed materially to the decided successes of this year
of the war. And with good reason; for they gave the Protestant princes
greater confidence in their cause and made the Emperor anxious for his
territory of Bohemia. Hamilton was one of those personages of high
rank who gave themselves up to the cause of the Queen of Bohemia with
chivalrous devotion. While the King of Sweden was pressing forward
into Saxony to try his strength against the arms of the League,
Hamilton guarded the passage of the Oder to provide for the possible
contingency of a retreat: but after the decisive battle at Breitenfeld,
not far from Leipsic, he turned his steps to Lusatia and Silesia. How
advantageous would King Charles have found it for his purpose, which
he thought to promote by combining Spanish influence and warlike
demonstrations in support of it, if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1631.</span> had
been able to offer places in Silesia in exchange for those in the
Palatinate! Hamilton had taken Guben, and was on the way to Glogau,
when Gustavus Adolphus, chiefly out of regard to Saxony, gave him
orders to turn aside towards the Elbe to besiege Magdeburg. Hamilton
looked upon this as an intentional injury done to Queen Elizabeth and
her consort. As the King of Sweden was advancing into West Germany
without a check, Hamilton hurried after him, hoping to be put at the
head of a separate division, and charged with the reconquest of the
Palatinate. But the number of the Scots and English had already melted
away to a great extent, owing to the unhealthiness of the climate and
to their marches through a devastated country: they were besides at
variance among themselves, so that he now threw no weight into the
scale. It was intimated to him that every one knew quite well that he
was not prosecuting his own cause, but that of the King of England: but
that no one would help him to attain his party-end by these means.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus was convinced that the enemy would not be able to
drive him out of Germany. He was more afraid of the coldness and
jealousy of his allies, who could easily undermine his authority<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>:
and he looked upon Charles I as one of them.</p>

<p>At Frankfort on the Main Henry Vane presented himself before Gustavus
Adolphus as ambassador of the King of England, in order to invite him
to restore the Elector Palatine to his country. The King of Sweden made
various objections, founded on his relations with France, which was
again showing much regard for the Catholic princes; but he principally
urged the request that King Charles should break with Spain<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.
People feared that whenever the King of England saw his brother-in-law
restored, he would throw himself entirely on the side of the Spaniards.
If, as Charles I said, his relations were such that an agreement with
Spain did not prevent him from forming a connexion with Sweden, they
yet involved the consequence that this was never very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1632.</span> close; for Sweden was allied with France, whose interests ran
exactly counter to those of Spain.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus saw with pleasure that the Elector Frederick, with
the support of the States-General, of the Prince of Orange and the
King of England, joined his camp and followed it for a time. Frederick
was present when Gustavus Adolphus conquered Kreuznach, formerly one
of his towns; and it appears possible that the reviving affection
of his subjects contributed to the result. A couple of English
regiments were also engaged here<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, and Frederick welcomed them with
satisfaction. He attended the King on his victorious march to the Lech
and into Bavaria; every word the King uttered strengthened his hopes
of returning in a short time to his country as sovereign. But when he
now desired to come forward on his own account and to arm, Gustavus
Adolphus would not accede to his wish. He gave him to understand that
this would interfere with the success of his own enlistments. The King
even hesitated to replace in his hands the government of those circles
of the Palatinate which had been reconquered; at all events he annexed
to his consent the condition that the Lutherans should be allowed
free profession of their faith. Everything led men to expect that if
he wrested from the Spaniards the two strongholds which they still
retained, he would keep them for a time in his own hands. Even in this
moment of apparent success Frederick endured hours of sadness and heavy
sorrow of heart. He once with tears in his eyes told Hamilton and Vere
that he had rather be out of the world than obliged to submit to the
conditions imposed by Sweden.</p>

<p>In October 1632 Frederick returned to his country. But in what a plight
did he find it on his return! Oppenheim, where he wished to take up
his residence, was half burnt down; the houses that were left standing
had no bolts or bars, no doors or windows. To avoid being carried
off by the first active bands of marauders, he set out for Mainz;
but a pestilent sickness was raging there; he was attacked by it and
perished, far from his wife and children. He had paid for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1633.</span> the short possession of a throne, which his own unassisted
strength was too weak to maintain, by a fugitive’s life, in which many
yielded him their sympathies, but none the help of which he stood in
need.</p>

<p>At that time his death was hardly remarked, in presence of the great
loss which the whole Protestant cause and the world in general
experienced when the King of Sweden fell on the battle-field of Lützen.</p>

<p>The two events exercised a concurrent influence upon England. King
Charles, after his brother-in-law’s death, regarded it as his duty
to identify his nephew’s cause still more closely with his own. The
death of the King of Sweden made his task easier, inasmuch as the
strong will, which had hitherto controlled every design, had now ceased
to act. Charles I now immediately invited the Protestant sovereigns
of Germany to carry on the war, by which the Palatinate was to be
restored; and in return he offered to continue to them the subsidies
which he had contributed to the King of Sweden. And Chancellor
Oxenstiern, who guided the Swedish policy, had weighty reasons himself
for respecting the interests of the Palatinate, as they were linked
not only with so many others in the Empire, but with those of the
Netherlands besides, and just now with those of Great Britain<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. In
May 1633, at the convention of Heilbronn, where the English ambassador
Anstruther appeared among others, the cause of the Palatinate received
more consideration than it ever had before. Electoral rank was conceded
for the first time to the plenipotentiary of the Palsgrave Louis
Philip, who came forward as administrator of the Palatinate in the name
of the Elector Charles Louis, who was still a minor. The Chancellor
of Sweden promised them the restoration of the whole country, so far
as it was in Swedish hands: and in the Consilium formatum, which it
was determined at Heilbronn to set up, to act in conjunction with him,
the Palatinate occupied the first place. In return the administrator
granted the restoration of the Lutheran faith: he left Mannheim, as
well as other important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span> places, in the hands
of Sweden for the time, and made himself answerable for the payment of
60,000 reichs thalers. These however the English ambassador undertook
to furnish; and in fact we find that immediately after this time
£15,000, which at that time was about equal to the sum stipulated,
was despatched to Germany. The King and Weston were well pleased
that England was not named in the treaty, nor pledged to further
advances<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. They now thought it preferable to leave the matter alone.</p>

<p>But the help of England could not but be often claimed hereafter in aid
of this cause.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1633 there was much talk of invoking the sympathies
of the English nation in behalf of the widowed Queen Elizabeth and her
children. Her friends flattered themselves that half a million thalers
might be raised by voluntary contributions; and Nethersole, one of
the Queen’s most trusty friends, was in the country to conduct the
transaction, which was to be carried out in the name of the Princess
and of the King. But it was soon perceived that the nation was not so
forward as had been expected; for it saw in this scheme an attempt to
evade the necessity of a Parliamentary grant. In order to meet this
suspicion the sketch of a proclamation was laid before the King, in
which the remark was made that he would measure the loyalty of his
people by the amount of their voluntary contributions, and would be the
more ready to seek their help in another way when the time for this
should have arrived<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. But this clause displeased the King, because
it contained a promise which he was reluctant to give, that Parliament
should be summoned; and he struck it out with his own hand<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. On this
the whole project fell to the ground, for without an assurance of this
sort the Queen’s friends had no hope of effecting anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1634.</span>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1633 there was a moment when the Emperor
again obtained advantages on the Upper Rhine; and the attention of
King Charles was called to the inability of the territory of the
Palatinate to resist even a feeble attack from the side of Alsace.
The administrator asked for only a small force of 6000 infantry and
1000 cavalry, which after it was once raised might be kept in pay
for £6000 a month. The Queen of Bohemia, the States-General, and the
French ambassador united their requests with his; the Chancellor of
Sweden sent his son over to recommend the King most strongly to accede
to them: but the King and his treasurer shrank from a new and regular
outlay, which in the present instance was sure to entail much other
expenditure. At last they raised 100,000 thalers for Germany, and sent
the administrator a gold chain in order to keep him in a good humour:
but they could not be moved to undertake an obligation which could lead
to the assembling of Parliament.</p>

<p>We should remark however that they were withheld from decisive action,
not only by want of money and by fees of Parliament, but also by
general political considerations as well.</p>

<p>In the last few years, since the leading of the King of Sweden in
Germany, the importance and power of the French had immeasurably
increased. They had the Protestant interest in Germany on their side,
and they already exercised a decisive influence on the Catholics
also. In all their proceedings it was seen that, notwithstanding the
advantages which they won, their allies derived no benefit, but that on
the contrary they only endeavoured to make their own position so strong
in order to be raised above all need of considering the interests of
other powers. Only one other state, Holland, raised itself side by side
with them to daily-increasing importance. Just at that time the Dutch
had thrown their English rivals into the shade: they had founded their
East Indian empire, they had established a footing in Brazil, they had
captured in the West Indian waters the Spanish register-ships which
went from Mexico to Havanna with all their rich cargo—an achievement
which the English had so often attempted in vain; and in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1635.</span> domestic waters, in the narrow channel of the
Slaak, they had annihilated the fleet of the Infanta Isabella which was
sailing to attack them. In consequence of this they also became masters
of the neighbouring seas. They did not hesitate to seek out ships under
the Spanish flag, especially those of Dunkirk, in English ports, or
in English waters, and to take them across to Holland as their lawful
prize. And even on land at that time they achieved important results.
By the successful surprise of Wesel they not only again secured their
own frontier, but once more infused some portion of vital power into
that principality on the Rhine, which had been formerly founded there
by Brandenburg in conjunction with England, but which certainly
required a longer time for its development. The sieges of Bois-le-duc
and Maastricht, notwithstanding so many other great events, riveted at
that time the attention of Europe. The success of the Dutch in these
two enterprises appeared a proof of their general superiority; the
provinces of the Spanish Netherlands were much straitened by it. And
as it revived in those provinces the hereditary feeling of dislike to
a foreign rule, Holland and France on their part might well think of
availing themselves of this dissatisfaction, and of putting an end for
ever by a sudden attack to the rule of Spain.</p>

<p>It is quite plain how great a blow the English would have sustained
if the whole coasts of this part of the continent had fallen into the
hands of these two neighbours, whose close alliance was in itself
very offensive to them<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. Against the danger of being entangled
in continental affairs, and of feeling their reflex action in Great
Britain, Charles I had to set off the other danger, if he held aloof
from them, of seeing new powers develop during their progress, which
might make his position most critical. In order to acquire the means of
resisting the ascendancy of France and Holland, he was obliged to make
fresh advances to Spain.</p>

<p>We can hardly form an idea for ourselves how much the relations between
England and Spain changed and shifted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1634.</span> the
great conflict which was going on. In the year 1631 a scheme was drawn
up for a great attack of the English and Spaniards upon the United
Netherlands, as a result of which Zealand should fall to the lot of the
former. As yet indeed there was no treaty, but only a plan sketched out
for further consideration, which Charles I avoided accepting, although
Cottington seems to have approved of it<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. But we see at all events
to what the aim of the Spaniards was directed. After a short time, when
they found themselves deceived, they entertained designs of an entirely
opposite character. A detailed plan of Count Olivarez is extant,
according to which Spain and France were to undertake a general attack
upon England<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. England, Scotland, and Ireland, were each to be
attacked separately, and internal animosities of every kind were to be
invoked in aid of the invaders. An idea was entertained of placing the
young Elector Palatine on the throne of England, under the condition
that he guaranteed full religious liberty and restored the expelled
Irish to their lost inheritance. On the other hand, in the summer of
1634 an alliance between Spain and England was again in progress.
Weston, Cottington, and Windebank, took counsel with the Spanish
resident, Don Juan Nicolalde, for this object, in such entire secrecy
that even Coke, the Secretary of State, had no information about it.
The King besought the court of Brussels, which on this occasion as on
others he was obliged to take into his confidence, to apply to no one
about this matter except himself and Windebank. The overtures which
he made to Spain at that time are accounted for by the ascendancy of
the Dutch marine and the rise of that of the French. The claim of
England to exercise a sort of supremacy over the neighbouring seas, was
once more called in question. The English contended for this right in
learned treatises<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; the King of France on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1635.</span> hand showed a determination no longer to acknowledge it. For,
as his ambassador said, everything must have its foundation in reason;
the usage of the sea only required that the less powerful should show
honour to the more powerful; even England could have no other claim:
and what would happen if the relative power of different states varied?
The English would not entertain this supposition, for they clung to the
principle that their navy must have the superiority over that of all
their neighbours<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, for this reason, if for no other, that, if it had
not, their neighbours could throw a far superior army on the shores of
England. And another principle was asserted at that time, which did
not find full acceptance until a quarter of a century later, viz. that
there must be an equilibrium between the European powers; for fears
were already felt lest France should become supreme by sea as well as
on land<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. Moreover King Charles was implored by English merchants
to protect them against the insults to which they were exposed, while
he was not even in a condition to give effect to his ordinances,
e.g. those which concerned the fisheries: he therefore cherished the
ardent wish to be able again to show himself strong by sea; it was to
a Spanish loan that he looked for the requisite means. For even in
reference to this object he was cramped by his misunderstanding with
Parliament. We shall see hereafter how fatal to the development of
domestic affairs were the measures which Charles I was induced to adopt
in order to attain this end. Certainly Spain, fully occupied by the war
in Germany, and threatened just now by a French war in the Netherlands,
could not give him the assistance he desired. But even though no
subsidy was forthcoming, yet at all events a common tie of interest
between England and Spain again grew out of the situation of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span>

<p>And this necessarily produced its effect on the treatment of the
controversy about the Palatinate. For, if in the general conduct
of affairs the King was inclined to favour Spain, how was it to be
expected that in the affairs of Germany he would with all his heart
support the allies of the French, whose ascendancy he was already
beginning to fear? The relation in which England thus stood had already
at times been advantageous to the Palatine dominions. After the battle
of Nordlingen, which restored to the Imperial arms their superiority in
Upper Germany, those districts had had some mercy shown them, at least
for a while, owing to this consideration; though on other occasions it
was completely lost sight of. In England an intention was cherished
of supporting the young Elector with the whole weight of the British
name, when in January 1636, on entering his eighteenth year, the time
should come for him to claim his hereditary rank and position; for
whatever guilt the father had incurred, they thought that it could not
be imputed to his children. In this matter the King had reckoned on
the good offices of Spain, and on the favour of the Emperor. Then came
the news of the treaty of Prague, the fulfilment of which was based
upon a new dynastic connexion between the whole house of Austria and
Bavaria, and upon the concurrence of the Elector of Saxony. The former
stipulations made in favour of Bavaria with regard to the Elector’s
dignity, and the dominions of the Palatinate were therein expressly
confirmed: the sister of Charles was promised her personal property,
and his nephews a maintenance proportioned to their rank so long as
they submitted; but these concessions were granted as a favour and not
as a right<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. These tidings produced on Charles I an impression of
the most painful surprise; he would hardly believe them: but he thought
that, if they were true, every effort must be made to cancel the
agreement. Now too, very much as in the year 1623, the Stuart policy
depended on the conclusion of an agreement with Austria and Spain.
Instructions of this import were given to Lord Aston, who went as envoy
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> Madrid: and John Taylor, an agent who was
not without experience in these transactions, was sent by Charles to
Vienna to protest against the provisions of the treaty, and to bring
the Emperor to another determination.</p>

<p>Taylor was one of those diplomatists who find their whole happiness in
the success of the mission committed to them: who accept as perfectly
genuine all the overtures made to them in regard to this object by
foreign courts; and therefore try to induce their own government to
accept them. In Vienna he fell in with John Leslie, one of the agents
in the murder of Wallenstein, who at that time was in high favour
with the court, and who introduced Taylor at the different princely
houses and procured him a good reception there. They both thought the
alliance of Charles I with the house of Austria the only hope for
the world. How glorious, they thought, would be the position of this
monarch: he would then be the most powerful of European sovereigns.
The Jesuits had already on one occasion, in a play performed at
their seminary at Prague, celebrated King Charles as the restorer
of universal peace. And how could the Imperial court itself fail
to be sensible of the advantageous prospect held out to them by a
connexion with England? On the 24th of February, 1636, the Emperor
declared that he would free the Count Palatine, Charles Louis, if he
made proper submission, from the ban under which he had been laid
owing to his father’s guilt; that he would again receive him among
the Princes of the Empire, and enfcoff him with no mean portion of
his father’s possessions: that if negotiations about the electoral
dignity were then opened, he would give proof of his favourable
disposition to the King, as well as to the young Prince, conceding
everything which could be granted to them under fair conditions<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
These were well-considered words, which made no promise but held out
all the greater hopes. Taylor interpreted them to mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> that the Lower Palatinate on both sides of the
Rhine would be restored at once; that negotiations about the Upper
Palatinate would be set on foot, and that the dignity of Elector would
be transferred to the young Palsgrave after the death of the Elector of
Bavaria. He reported that Charles I would receive an assurance on the
subject in writing from the Emperor, and his son the King of Hungary,
and also from the King of Spain; and that the young Prince would be
married to an archduchess, and become greater that any Elector Palatine
had ever been. He said that the Queen of Hungary, to whom Charles had
once paid court in Spain, had not yet forgotten him, and that the old
Elector of Bavaria was derided by her court; that it was intended to
restore the old Burgundian alliance between the two houses; that even
the Spanish ambassador Oñate, who was at first less favourable to the
plan, had said that Spain wished for the friendship of the King of
England, not in part but altogether, and only hoped that he would renew
his ancestors’ claims on France<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>In England, Taylor’s ardour had never been approved; but the affair
seemed to have reached a point at which further negotiations might be
committed to one of the magnates of the kingdom, Thomas Howard, Earl
of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of England, whom the King had once
rightly styled the most distinguished of his subjects<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. From the
statements of the Secretary employed in these affairs, it is clear
that Charles would have been quite contented with such terms as might
be hoped from the tenor of Taylor’s despatches. In June 1636 we find
Arundel at Linz, where at that time the Emperor had arrived on his way
to the meeting of the Electors, which was to be held at Ratisbon, for
the choice of his successor.</p>

<p>But a very unexpected difficulty showed itself at once. The full
powers entrusted to the Imperial commissioners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1636.</span> appointed to negotiate with Arundel, rested on the assumption
that an offensive and defensive alliance would be concluded between
England and the house of Austria. Arundel was one of those statesmen
who were generally considered to favour Spain; but he was haughty and
measured, and had neither inclination nor authority to form so close
an alliance. England wished to conclude a treaty with both lines of
the house of Austria as secretly as possible, in order to be able on
the one hand to offer resistance to the French by sea, and on the
other to promote the interest of the Elector Palatine: but she did not
desire to plunge into open war with Holland and France. The Imperial
ministers referred to Taylor’s overtures; but the latter proved that
he had spoken, officially at least, only of an intimate understanding,
and not of an offensive and defensive alliance<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. Arundel remarked,
that the understanding could only be of such a character that all other
sovereigns also might be admitted into it. He was out of humour that
the other side should have intended to lead him unperceived further
than his King thought of going.</p>

<p>Although this beginning certainly argued no good, the negotiations
were still by no means rendered hopeless, so long as the prospect of
a close connexion was maintained. On the contrary, though Arundel had
at first pressed for the restoration of the Elector Palatine to his
full rights, he now only asked whether such a restoration might be
expected, at least at some future time. The Imperial ministers repeated
the declaration given on the 24th of February, with the additional
statement that the King of England might promise himself the more
affection from the Emperor as the ambassador gave assurance of the
sincere good intentions of the King towards him: but they proceeded
to indicate the conclusion of an alliance as a necessary condition.
Further progress was deferred until the time of the negotiations, which
were to be conducted at Ratisbon<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span>

<p>For these negotiations nothing was more needful than that the Imperial
ministers should first of all be agreed among themselves how far they
were willing to go. But how could they have taken any steps at all
without conferring with Bavaria? In the face of the impending Diet
of the Electors, they could least of all have ventured to affront
the powerful sovereign, with whom so many others took part. They
sent a special mission to invite him to express his views to them
categorically: at the same time they called his attention to the
importance of the English fleet at that juncture.</p>

<p>The Elector Maximilian attached little weight to this. He answered,
that Germany certainly had nothing to fear from this fleet, and that
France, which was just as well equipped by sea, would not be deterred
even by the enmity of England from extending its power in Germany: that
Charles I moreover could not long keep his fleet at sea, for that he
was on bad terms with his Estates of the realm, without whose assent
he certainly could not reckon upon any permanent contribution. It is
remarkable that this consideration which exercised so much influence on
the decisions of the King himself, also affected the attitude of other
powers towards him, and influenced a negotiation carried on between
Austria and Bavaria.</p>

<p>But even apart from this, what would come of it, Maximilian asked, if
concessions were made to the presumptuous demands of England? He said
that for his part he was not disinclined to surrender under certain
conditions the district of the Lower Palatinate, which he had in his
hands, but not the Upper Palatinate, which he held in pledge: that the
Emperor by virtue of his authority had made over the electoral dignity
to him and his house for ever: that this settlement had been made in
concert with the other Electors, and that his father and cousin, the
Emperor, would not wish to reverse it: that he could not, if he would.</p>

<p>On the resumption of negotiations with England, Count Olivarez remarked
that they had been broken off for other reasons, no doubt those very
reasons which arose out of the stipulations of Saxony and Bavaria with
regard to the Palatinate. He thought however that even now Charles
I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> take no decided action in behalf of
Spain, and would always look to his own interests alone. The great
successes of the Spanish army in the year 1636 perhaps enhanced his
self-confidence: and when negotiations were renewed, the Spaniards were
rather on the side of Bavaria than on that of England.</p>

<p>The Imperial court was then confronted by the same question which
had formerly been discussed in Spain in the year 1623. Was it to
show compliance towards England, and for the sake of this break off
its connexion with Bavaria, and quarrel with Spain? The question was
submitted to the Emperor’s successor, who decided that in this case
England must be disregarded<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>A formal answer to this effect was communicated to Arundel at
Ratisbon on September 12. The restoration of the Count Palatine to
the Electorship was deferred until events should have happened, which
seemed to Arundel about as near as the end of the world. He remarked
that, if his sovereign had been told this before, he would never have
sent him to Germany. He returned to England deeply incensed, for he
thought that, personally as well as officially, he had not met with the
consideration which he had a right to claim.</p>

<p>This was the second time that the Austro-Spanish house refused to
draw closer to England from regard to its relations with Germany.
There is no doubt that, for the German branch in the present state of
affairs, the maintenance of Catholicism and of an alliance with Bavaria
outweighed all other considerations. But was this the case also with
the Spanish branch? For it, both for the sake of the monarchy and its
general position in European politics, a closer agreement with England
even under the Stuarts would have been of inestimable advantage.
Olivarez differed from Lerma, in that the latter studied most carefully
the general and maritime interests of Spain, the former her interests
in Germany and on the continent. The mistake of the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1636.</span> Stuarts lay in this, that they thought to find in Spain
the centre of gravity of the joint relations of the two houses, even
after it had been transferred to Austria. In that long and bloody
conflict between all the continental powers, which we term the Thirty
Years’ War, England also had her interest. James I and Charles I never
wholly lost sight of the principal aim of their continental policy, the
restoration of the Elector Palatine. But they never staked their whole
power on the issue. They once stirred up Denmark to conduct the cause;
they then allied themselves with Sweden in order directly to attain
their object. But for all that they would never adopt as their own the
common political point of view of the Protestant powers. They would
far rather, from first to last, have procured from the Emperor the
recovery of the Palatinate by means of Spanish influence. But even for
securing this the means which they set in motion were not sufficient.
Their misunderstandings with Parliament rendered strong measures on
their part impossible, just where it was most necessary. In the great
continental struggle which must be decisive as to the future condition
of Europe, the Stuarts could not interfere to influence the result.
Meanwhile they were pursuing their own special end.</p>

<p>Whilst the agitation of the world was at high tide, Charles I in his
insular domain, which was affected by it without feeling its full
force, was scheming to establish for ever the kingly power.</p>

<span class="small">MONARCHICAL TENDENCIES OF THE HOME GOVERNMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Among the English ministers Lord Treasurer Weston, who at that time
exercised the greatest influence upon foreign affairs, and had almost
the sole direction of domestic matters, afforded, a signal instance
of successful activity. He had formerly taken office, when matters
were almost desperate. The English were still at war with both the
neighbouring powers; enormous demands were made for the support of the
forces by land and sea. The former moreover were burdensome to the
districts on which they were quartered: none of the civil officials
had been paid for several years: the considerable burden of debt which
James I had bequeathed to his successor (£1,200,000), was increased a
third by the years spent in war; and as interest was paid at the rate
of 8 per cent. for the earlier, and 12 per cent. for the later loan,
it absorbed the greater portion of the revenue. But this latter, which
was principally derived from customs, had been rendered precarious by
the dispute about tonnage and poundage. Bales of woollen goods had been
sent back from the ports to the manufacturing towns because the owners
refused to pay the duty; and foreign merchants had abstained from
having their wares landed because they expected unpleasant treatment
from the population if they paid the customs. The trade of the country
was at a standstill. How entirely matters were altered after five years
of Weston’s strict and watchful administration! Peace was concluded
and maintained; the counties freed from the soldiers quartered on
them; the customs regularly levied; at least half of the old debts
paid off;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1634.</span> English commerce developed into the
most flourishing and productive in the world, if for no other reason,
because the continent, and all the neighbouring seas, were distracted
with war.</p>

<p>Richard Weston had attained a certain reputation among legal circles
in the Middle Temple, and in embassies of the second grade: he had
then been engaged by Buckingham in higher political affairs, and after
the death of the latter had to a certain extent stepped into his
place. His policy however was altogether different. The active desire
for war was replaced by a readiness for peace at any price. Weston
informed the French that even in the service of his King he loved their
interests. If, in spite of this, he had dealings with the Spaniards,
the French had no fears on that score: they found that he would never
break either with them or with their opponents, because his thoughts,
as well as those of the King, were directed solely to the maintenance
of neutrality in foreign affairs<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, and in domestic affairs to
economy and the avoidance of a Parliament. Weston himself did not
long remain the pliant and complaisant person which he had formerly
been. He now appeared inaccessible, close, rude, imperious<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. He
was always careful to have a sum of money in hand, of which he could
dispose: in order to avoid expenditure he stopped the despatch of a
foreign mission: the most rigid barriers were erected round the royal
generosity. After the fashion of the statesmen of that period, he did
not forget his own interests: he was made Earl of Portland, and by
the marriage of his son with a lady of the house of Lennox, he became
related to the royal family. All who enjoyed a certain importance in
the kingdom were on his side, Arundel, Cottington, Wentworth, as well
as James Hay, Earl of Carlisle, among the Scots who had come over
with James the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> one who knew how to make
himself at home in England: he was regarded as the man who understood
the position of foreign affairs better than any one in England.
Weston could not but have rivals and adversaries. At their head was
Henry Rich, Earl of Holland, who had taken a considerable share in
the negotiations for bringing the Queen home, and who since then had
always adhered to her. He appeared the most brilliant and, owing to the
favour shown him by both of the royal pair alike, the most prosperous
member of the court. For a time he had a good prospect of becoming
Buckingham’s successor in the admiralty as well as in the royal favour.
But neither he himself, nor his friends, were of such importance as to
become dangerous to the Treasurer. When Cottington returned from Spain,
efforts were made to separate him from Weston. He was advised to attach
himself immediately to the Queen, who was no friend of that minister;
but Cottington preferred his old political connexion, which secured
him greater prospects. Weston knew how to obliterate all unfavourable
impressions in the King’s mind, and to regain his confidence, which
once or twice seemed to waver. Besides this, it was a principle of the
King to bestow his chief confidence upon one man alone, and to cling
to him, and let people say against him what they would; for he thought
that the nature of political life was such that every one attacked the
possessor of authority<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>


<h3 id="TAXES"><i>Taxes levied without a grant of Parliament.</i></h3>

<p>Economy did not suffice to secure for the government complete
independence in administration: means had therefore to be adopted to
increase the receipts. Tonnage and poundage, the amount of which had in
a few years increased by £80,000, offered the principal resource for
effecting this object.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span> But when old records
were searched, other crown rights of earlier date were discovered which
had fallen into oblivion, and might be revived with advantage.</p>

<p>How many persons, it was said, had been bound by old usage to appear at
the King’s coronation, in order to be knighted!</p>

<p>The government called to account all who had incurred the guilt
of neglecting this duty, in order that a pecuniary fine might be
levied on them<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. Another feudal right of royalty had a still
wider application. In April 1633 the Earl of Holland, who sometimes
took part with the government although he did not love it, was seen
driving through London in a royal carriage to Stratford in Essex, in
order to hold his court there as Lord Forester in the fashion of the
twelfth century. He cited all those who had built within the borders
of the ancient royal forests to appear, that he might investigate
their titles. The occupants in vain affirmed that the claims of
the crown against them had long ago been redeemed by purchase: as
they had no documentary proof of this, they were compelled to pay a
sum in acquittance, which in Essex alone amounted to £300,000<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.
Lord Holland opened his court in August at Winchester, to try cases
connected with the New Forest: in September, attended by five judges,
he went into Northamptonshire to the site of those same woods,
which had once served as a refuge for the Britons, and then as a
hunting-ground for the Norman kings, that he might exact penalties
for encroachments on the forest of Rockingham. Some of the leading
nobles, the Earl of Westmorland, Lord Peterborough, Lord Newport, and
the Earl of Salisbury, were condemned, the last-named on account of
an estate which had been presented to his father, Robert Cecil, by
Queen Elizabeth<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. And these claims were constantly being stretched
further: it appeared as if the greater part of England would soon
be considered as having been forest-land in former days. Even the
government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1634.</span> now felt itself in a critical
position from the agitation kindled by this conduct, and suspended
proceedings for a moment<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>In spite of so many declarations made to Parliament, monopolies
of different kinds were again granted by the crown, especially to
associations which were formed for the exclusive prosecution of some
branch of trade, and which were regularly invested with the rights and
constitution of companies with governor, assistants, and society. They
were obliged to purchase their title by yearly payments, but in return
were then supported in those vexatious regulations which they made to
enforce it. Other sovereign rights furnished an opportunity of levying
considerable taxes on separate articles<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. It is calculated that
up to the year 1635 Charles I had raised his income from £500,000 to
£800,000.</p>

<p>The King, says Correro the Venetian, moves among the rocks by which
he is surrounded, slowly but surely. The judges explain the laws in
his favour, as there are no Parliaments to contradict them: and his
subjects do not then venture to withstand him. ‘With the key of the
laws he seeks to open the entrance to absolute power<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.’</p>

<p>By far the most important and remarkable of all his claims was the
demand for ship-money.</p>

<p>Those were times in which he thought it necessary to oppose the
resistance of a powerful navy to the maritime encroachments of
the Dutch and French. We have seen that for this purpose he asked
for subsidies from Spain, but was unable to obtain them. In the
embarrassment into which he was thrown in consequence, a very welcome
prospect of assistance was held out, when some of his supporters who
were learned in the law maintained that he had the right to demand
the aid of the country for this object even without the assent of
Parliament. As by English usage the duty of defending the country
and of guarding the sea was laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1634.</span> on him,
this duty, it was said, carried with it also the right of making the
necessary dispositions for that purpose. They adduced a series of
precedents, according to which monarchs on their own authority, without
the support of Parliament even when it was sitting, and only with the
consent of the Privy Council, had issued the requisite proclamation
for equipping naval armaments, and had met with obedience down to the
end of the reign of Edward III. To the objection that this was more
than two centuries and half ago, the King’s supporters replied, that
the continuance of an opposite usage for any length of time could not
cancel the right of the sovereign, and that even in the most recent
times an instance had occurred, for that the whole warlike preparations
by which the attack of the Spanish Armada had been repulsed in the year
1588, had been set on foot at the sole order of Queen Elizabeth<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. At
the present moment, when the old sovereignty of England over the seas
was contested by the neighbouring powers, a similar proceeding appeared
peculiarly justifiable. Not only were the seaport towns summoned to
furnish the King with a specified number of ships of a certain tonnage
for a period of six months, but the obligation was extended to the
inland counties and towns, and in their case the ships were commuted
for an assessment of money, which was to be raised in the same way as a
subsidy. There was even a design entertained of having a number of men
embodied for the defence of the coast.</p>

<p>Much agitation had been caused by the previous renewal of old claims;
and it was naturally doubled by this last claim, because it was the
most comprehensive, and might be renewed at pleasure. The loudest
remonstrances were heard. The official interpreters of the laws however
came forward on the side of the crown, and acknowledged its right. In
November 1634 the Judges gave sentence that the inland as well as the
seaboard towns might be called upon for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span>
defence of the coasts. This judgment did not contain a declaration that
Parliament need not be consulted in the matter; but in February 1636 a
decision on this point also followed<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. It was declared by a sentence
of the Judges, that if the kingdom were in danger, and the king thought
it necessary, he had the right of ordering his subjects under the Great
Seal of England to equip as large a number of ships as seemed to him
necessary; and that in case they should refuse to do so, the law gave
him perfect right to compel them. The judges could not have delivered
a more important decision: it is one of the great events of English
history. The King commanded that it should be entered in the records
of the Star Chamber, and of the Courts of Justice at Westminster, and
that all possible publicity should be given to it, in order that every
one who had doubted the King’s right might be taught to know better.
But even the sentence of the Courts of Justice had no longer absolute
authority in England, where they were now deemed subservient or even
corrupt. A gentleman of Buckinghamshire, John Hampden, who had there a
very old family estate, refused to pay the sum for which he had been
assessed, twenty shillings, not because of the amount, which was only
trifling, but in order to bring the matter once more publicly under
discussion. When he was cited before the Star Chamber to answer for
it, he requested to hear the writ. After it had been read, he denied
that it had any legal authority over him. The King, who thought himself
perfectly certain of his right, had no objection that the question
should once more be publicly discussed. Nor did he order others also
who refused payment to be visited with penalties of real severity:
the sheriffs in each case merely seized possession of property to the
amount which they had to raise from each according to the assessment.
They met with no resistance in this; but men refused to acknowledge
the claim by voluntary payment. ‘They stick to their laws,’ writes one
of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> Venetian informants, ‘and allow legal
proceedings to be taken, solely to make it known that the laws are
violated, and that they are compelled to pay by force<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.’</p>

<p>But what a state of affairs hereupon set in! The whole administration
of the state depended on the receipt of tonnage and poundage, the
payment of which Parliament declared illegal, while the government
insisted on it, on the ground that it had been made to the earlier
kings; and all refusals of payment were overridden by the coercive
power of the state. All other fiscal measures as well were considered
wanton attacks on the fully acknowledged rights of private property,
or as illegal. People gave way, but only in the expectation of better
times.</p>

<p>The opposition between what the government and what the nation or the
Parliament thought legitimate, was presented in the sharpest outlines,
when it led to acts of personal oppression. The members of Parliament,
against whom the King had claims, refused to be brought to trial
before the Courts of Justice before which they were summoned; for they
affirmed that Parliament alone had the right to pronounce judgment on
their conduct. They were condemned however, and the most resolute of
them, Sir John Eliot, was treated with a severity bordering on cruelty:
he died in the Tower<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>At times however the King’s indulgence and mercy in turn appeared
illegal, especially when they were extended to Catholics. This had so
important an influence in the life of the King, that we must devote to
it a closer examination.</p>


<h3 id="CHARLES_I"><i>Charles the First’s relations with Catholicism.</i></h3>

<p>The old severe laws of Parliament against priests and Jesuits still
existed, but, as the King had promised in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span>
marriage-contract, they were no longer enforced. It was not only that
the bloody executions of former times could not now be thought of,
but even the pecuniary fines incurred by non-attendance at Protestant
worship were reduced to half their amount, or redeemed in perpetuity by
compositions allowed under the Great Seal. The spies who had formerly
forced their way into houses, in order to look for priests who were
thought to be hidden there, no longer showed themselves; and steps
were taken under the influence of the Queen altogether to annul their
authority to do so. The English Catholics affirmed that they had never
enjoyed so much repose and security as under King Charles<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. Yet
they felt anxious, because the existing laws could legally be revoked
only by Parliament. The King certainly thought the power of dispensing
from them an essential part of the prerogative; but public opinion
took a different view, and the adherents of Parliamentary authority,
especially the Puritans, on the contrary insisted that the laws must be
as strictly enforced on this point as on any other.</p>

<p>And had they not in fact some ground for feeling anxious lest
Catholicism in this way should again obtain the ascendancy in the
country? In the Netherlands, in France, in Spain, and at Rome, those
seminaries were still flourishing, from which in former times young and
zealous priests had been sent to England. At that time there might be
counted in England five hundred secular priests, about three hundred
ecclesiastics belonging to the great orders, and about a hundred and
sixty Jesuits. Most of them were entertained in the principal families
in the country, who secretly or even openly professed Catholicism,
and in the houses of the rich proprietors, nobles, and gentry. In
countless places the Catholic service was celebrated, but with most
splendour in the residences of the ambassadors, where men vied with
one another, especially in keeping Holy Week with devout pomp, with
sensuous representations and musical services. On high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1636.</span> festivals the Queen and her court appeared in her public chapel,
which was served by Capuchin monks in the dress of their order: besides
this she had a private chapel. Just as an agent of the Queen had gone
to Rome, so now an agent of the Papal See, although under another
pretext, appeared at the English court. Even there Catholicism found
rich and powerful patrons. At the head of these was Thomas Howard, Earl
of Arundel, who now, as has been mentioned, stood high at court: the
King’s ministers, Weston and Cottington, and Windebank, the Secretary
of State, belonged to this party. The opinion had spread, and is still
constantly echoed, that King Charles also shared in these tendencies,
and sought to bring back his kingdom to Catholicism.</p>

<p>We are in possession of the copious letters of the Pope’s agent
Cuneo—a Scot whose real name was Con, but whom we shall speak of
under the Italianised form of his name—from which we may gather with
certainty how far the opinion was true, and how far it was not.</p>

<p>The negotiations on which Cuneo was engaged principally concerned the
form of oath by which King James had long ago wished to ensure the
loyalty of the Catholics. By the wording of the oath as adopted by
Parliament, the doctrine that the Pope could absolve subjects from
their obedience to their prince, was not only rejected, but expressly
termed heretical<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. The first archpriest who had the supervision of
the Catholic clergy in England was induced, as we have seen, to take
this oath; and many missionaries, among whom were even some of the
regular clergy, the Benedictines especially, followed his example.
Others thought that the scruple would be removed by a declaration
that the King required obedience only in civil matters. The Jesuits,
following the example of Bellarmin, rejected every expedient of this
sort, and zealous believers sided with them. This point however,
according to Charles’s views, was one of great importance. He seldom
caused the oath to be tendered; but when he had once done so, he
required it to be taken; if it were not, the objector was put under
a sort of civil excommunication.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> The matter
had been already mentioned by Giorgio Panzani in a former mission,
and the Papal court had empowered Cuneo to prevail on the King to
alter the oath<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. The inadmissibility of the present form was put
especially on the ground that no one could call a doctrine heretical,
until it had been declared so by the Church: it was demanded that the
King should lay down such a formula as would only affect the obedience
of his subjects in temporal matters, without touching the spiritual
question. And a very earnest endeavour was made to find such a formula.
It was proposed to say nothing about a ‘damnable doctrine,’ but only
to speak of the conviction of each individual: and Cuneo assured the
King that no Catholic would refuse to take such an oath, if only at the
same time he were relieved from the other. Against this the King had
two objections. He called Cuneo’s attention to the fact that the oath
had been prescribed by Parliament; that for its removal it would be
necessary to call Parliament together and to lay the alteration before
it—a proceeding which might have very unpleasant consequences, most of
all for the Catholics. ‘Sire,’ broke in Cuneo, ‘we Catholics hold that
your Majesty is superior to Parliament<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.’ The King thought that even
here he might invoke his dispensing power: but to put a new formula
in the place of the old, and merely to drop the enforcement of a law,
were quite different things. The former course was neither congenial
to the King, nor could have been ventured on by his ministers, who in
their departure from parliamentary government still kept always within
a line which they did not overstep. But besides this the King would
not deviate from his own doctrine, viz. that the right of kings was a
divine right, and could not be superseded by any man, not even by the
Pope<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. The opposition between the Papal and the Royal power might
perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> be smoothed over in practice, but could
never be adjusted in theory. People at Rome were not content with the
proposals of Cuneo, which were rejected by Charles.</p>

<p>In the course of these negotiations, or perhaps in the course of
friendly conversation, a further step was made. Something was said of
the necessity of a closer political, and of the possibility of a closer
religious approximation. Cuneo set before the King the prospect that
in the event of an union with Rome, which still formed a great centre
of European politics, he would have as much power as any continental
potentate: and the King might well feel tempted to enter the lists at
Rome as elsewhere against Spain and France. But Cuneo did not go so far
as to make a real attempt to convert him. The amiable ecclesiastical
diplomatist and courtier felt far too strong a conviction that he could
not venture on this. At times the prevailing controversies between
the two churches were touched upon in conversation. The King did not
conceal that, from all that he had seen in Spain, or even heard from
theologians there, an impression of estrangement had been left on his
mind<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. His Anglican heart rejected the adoration of saints and the
invocation of the Virgin, and was completely repelled by other forms
of popular worship. Cuneo once asked him what he held to be true
besides Holy Scripture<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. Charles answered that he held the three
creeds and the decrees of the first four councils; and he expressed
his astonishment that any one could put the decrees of the Council of
Trent on a level with those of the old councils. Once, after a decision
had been given in favour of the Catholics, Cuneo fell on his knee and
kissed his hand. ‘You will, nevertheless,’ said the King, ‘not make
a Papist of me.’ On one matter Charles would have been glad to hear
the expression of the Pope’s sentiments, namely, on the divine right
of bishops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> on the assumption of which the
constitution of the English Church, and the ecclesiastical policy of
the English kings mainly rested. But that was a very serious question
for the Pope, who wished neither to outrage the convictions of the
King, nor to lead the Catholic bishops to renew their former claims.
Pope Urban VIII avoided expressing even a personal opinion on the
subject.</p>

<p>A very lively impulse was given to the spiritual movement of the
seventeenth century by the attempts to reunite the two communions. It
had become clear as a result of a worldwide conflict again and again
repeated, that Protestantism could not be overpowered. The inroad of
the Swedes into Germany, the revival of the Protestant credit which
was connected with it, the alliance of France with the Protestant
powers, all gave a shape to European affairs in presence of which the
hope of effecting a restoration of Catholicism must have appeared a
cobweb of the brain. This led naturally to a revival of the old plans
for bringing to pass some kind of reconciliation between the opposing
churches. We meet with them in France, in Germany, in Poland, over
the whole Continent. They were cherished by well-intentioned kings,
powerful ministers, and learned writers of the first rank.</p>

<p>In England there was in each of the two great parties a fraction which
closely resembled the corresponding fraction on the other side. In
the one party there were found many who took the oath of allegiance
without hesitation, who acknowledged the supremacy of the crown, and
attended Anglican churches, who made a figure in high places, and then
perhaps after all declared themselves Catholics on their deathbeds.
We might almost suspect that, from a superstitious opinion of the
saving power of ceremonies, or because it was the safest course, they
kept priests in their houses only for this last hour. But even among
the Protestants we discover not a few who sought to strengthen the
resemblances to Catholicism which were retained in the English Church.
This was done principally out of dislike to the Puritans, who declared
that the Pope was the Antichrist foretold by Scripture; while the
others were inclined to recognise in him the true Patriarch of the
West, if he would only admit some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> moderation in
the exercise of his power. From this point of view they had publicly
condemned the schism in sermons, at which the King and the court were
present. They praised auricular confession and the bowing of the knee
at the sacred name or before the crucifix<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. Even in the local
arrangements of churches the innovations of the Reformers were done
away. Everywhere the communion table had again to give way to the
altar. Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, acknowledged that the Church of
Rome had an uncorrupted tradition on the main points of the Christian
faith. He avoided the harsh expressions of controversial theologians
about that Church, and loved to speak of a reunion between the divided
members of the whole body of the Church. But he was by no means a
Papist. Like the King he condemned the popular worship, especially the
invocation of saints: in the adoration of the sacrament, the refusal
of the cup, and the doctrine of purgatory, he also saw error, or
superstition, or both. When, after his appointment, the question was
put to him whether he would not be willing to become a cardinal of the
Roman Church, that was only an attempt to kindle his ambition, and to
open negotiations, which might have had further consequences: but he
did not fall into the snare. After a time people on the contrary spoke
of the probability that Cuneo might be raised to this dignity, which
he hoped to achieve by the aid of the Queen, and that he might then
remain in England wearing the purple. The Roman court was apprehensive
lest a violent ecclesiastical quarrel for precedence might thus be
raised. Between Cuneo and Laud, who outside the English court were
considered allies, harmony by no means prevailed: they did not get
beyond the external forms of ordinary politeness to one another.
From the beginning Laud could not endure that another ecclesiastical
influence should exist at court beside his own. Cuneo’s letters to Rome
show an ill-feeling towards the Archbishop<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> which is mingled with
bitterness, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> with a kind of contempt.
Cuneo declares him incapable of contributing in the least to the
removal of the English schism.</p>

<p>With absolute certainty we can pronounce that the statement which was
then made, that Charles in connexion with Cuneo and Laud designed
to bring back the English nation to Catholicism, is erroneous. The
supposed allies were personally bitter antagonists. The King, with his
Archbishop, adhered to the point of view of the Anglican Church, which
they only endeavoured to raise to complete supremacy.</p>


<h3 id="STATE_OF_OPINION"><i>State of Opinion in the Church of England at this time.</i></h3>

<p>The controversy which then most busily engaged men of active minds, did
not concern the differences between Catholicism and Protestantism. Only
as to the frontiers of the spiritual and temporal power were opinions
still wavering: on all other points every man had already taken his
side. Even the old dispute between Lutherans and Calvinists about
the Lord’s Supper, although it still went on, attracted no special
attention. The questions, which are properly traced to the spirit of
the age, were fought out within the domain of the Reformed Church.
They concerned the doctrine of election by grace, which determined the
system of dogmas, and the influence in spiritual affairs appertaining
to the temporal power, which was of decisive importance for the
constitution of the Church. The Synod of Dort derived widespread
importance from its adherence to the strict Calvinistic doctrines
of unconditional election by grace, and of the independence of the
Church. It condemned the Arminians, who were inclined to less rigid
views on both questions: they were expelled from their offices in the
Netherlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1619.</span>

<p>At an earlier period James I also had condemned Arminianism as
promoting tendencies towards Catholicism. But the theories of this
sovereign were always thrust into the background by his interests; and
when the decrees of this synod, in which some English theologians had
also taken part, though to a very slight extent, roused controversies
in England which threatened to disturb the repose and even the system
of the Church of England, it no longer commanded his sympathies. He
forbade the theological question to be discussed publicly in the
pulpits; just as in the articles of the English Church it had already
been handled with great caution. Still more repugnant to him was
the article in the conclusions of the Synod of Dort, in which equal
authority was ascribed to all ministers of God’s Word, whatever
position they might hold<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. The English members of the Synod, who
looked upon this as an indirect condemnation
of the constitution of the Church of England, protested against it, of
course without obtaining a hearing. But how obnoxious must this article
have been to the sovereign, who designed to found his state upon the
alliance of the Protestant mitre with the sceptre! His Presbyterian
opponents now acquired the support of an assembly which, by its very
strictness on other points, gained for itself great authority in the
Reformed Church. What was termed Puritanism was, strictly speaking,
the combination of the dogmatic decrees of the Synod of Dort with
resistance to episcopacy. So far as we know, the Archbishop of
Spalatro, Marcus Antonius de Dominis, who at that time had taken refuge
in England, was the first who used the word in this sense<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>There could be no more hearty admirer of the Anglican Church than this
foreign Archbishop. His works on this controversy, which although
voluminous are written with learning and candour, have contributed to
maintain the reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span> of the constitution
of the English Church in the eyes of the literary and theological
world<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>In August 1633 a great alteration took place in the state of the
English Church. George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury was removed
by death; a man who himself inclined to Puritanism, for he was a
zealous Calvinist, and in the exercise of ecclesiastical authority
displayed an amount of indulgence and clemency that brought on him
the reproaches of many. He had long ago ceased to influence the
court, or the relations which the church and the crown bore towards
each other. Charles I reposed his whole confidence in William Laud,
at that time Bishop of London, whose opinions agreed with his own,
or at any rate were in harmony with his tendencies. But in regard to
doctrine Laud’s Arminianism went even beyond that of Arminius; and
the combination witnessed at Dort, of strict Calvinistic opinions,
which he rejected, with resistance to episcopal government turned him
completely into a declared opponent of the Synod. For his own part he
considered episcopacy a divine institution, and contested the Christian
character of all those churches which were not episcopally organised.
And just because this institution was so deeply rooted in Christian
antiquity, he endeavoured in every respect to return to the oldest
usages. Before his eyes and those of the King floated the vision of
an episcopal church independent of the Papacy, which, purified from
all human additions, should embrace the whole world. Laud was very
highly educated, and showed an appreciation of universal learning:
he did much for the printing of Greek, for the acquisition of Arabic
and Persian manuscripts, and for the promotion of Oriental studies in
general. He was blameless in private life, and extremely beneficent:
out of his ecclesiastical revenue he always set aside a considerable
portion for the poor. But he was one of those men in whom the temper of
persecuting orthodoxy seems to be innate. Even in his youth he noticed
chiefly those passages in the lectures of professors which ran counter
to the Anglican system, of which he early formed a high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1633.</span> conception. In this temper he read the writings which were
called forth by the controversies of the day, and then invoked the
vengeance of the temporal and spiritual power on the deviations from
accepted formulas which he noticed in them. In the disputes between
the Government and the Parliament be lent his pen to the service of
the former with vigour and not without success; and Buckingham, with
whom he was most closely connected, promoted him to the see of London.
After Buckingham’s death the King transferred to the Bishop a portion
of the confidence and favour which he had bestowed upon the Duke.
Laud might be considered his ecclesiastical favourite. On the first
intelligence of Abbot’s death, Charles I saluted the Bishop of London
as Archbishop of Canterbury. For what could be nearer to his heart
than to transfer the authority of Primate of England to the man who
fully shared his point of view? On this the Anglican zealot stepped
into an official position which opened the widest sphere of action for
his ecclesiastical tendencies. He was a man of comprehensive energy,
which operated in all directions, and at the same time retained its
ardour. With large general designs he united indefatigable attention
to details<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. But all defects which Laud observed in the Church he
attributed to the indulgence of his predecessors, especially of the
late Archbishop, George Abbot: he had resolved to take an opposite
course, and to suffer no departure from the law of the Church and from
rigid obedience. Such deviations were punished in the bishops when they
made any resistance to the institution of ceremonies, as in the case of
Williams, Bishop of Lincoln<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>; how much more in the Puritans, whom
he regarded as the most dangerous adversaries of the orthodox system.
Woe to the man who ventured to bring forward a controverted point
in the pulpit, when once it had been forbidden there: the smallest
hint of it was fatal. Laud set himself against even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1637.</span> the religious strictness of the Puritans. In the Sabbatarian
controversy, which was then being set on foot, he advocated the Sunday
amusements of the people as warmly as the King. An ordinance issued
by him on the subject roused disapprobation even among clergymen who
conformed in other respects. The Archbishop appears to have thought
that by this indulgence he would attract the people to his side. But
even in this matter he went to work with an intolerance that could
not fail to alienate men’s sympathies from him. We know how zealously
the Puritans condemned theatrical representations, which just at that
time, when French actresses were introduced, appeared doubly obnoxious.
William Prynne, of Lincoln’s Inn, who wrote a copious book called
Histriomastix, suffered in consequence the most degrading penalties;
he was branded and lost his ears. The same punishment was inflicted
on Bastwick, a physician, who on his return from travelling related
much that was discreditable to foreign bishops, and which might be
unfavourably applied to the English bishops also. The theologian
Burton, who blamed as novelties some alterations that were introduced
into the Church, fared no better. These were educated men, and belonged
to the upper classes; and their exposure in the pillory, which was
intended to disgrace them, was turned into a kind of triumph. Laud
indeed intended to establish for ever the unassailable authority of
the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, just as he had emancipated afresh
the ecclesiastical courts from the influence of the temporal: but
without doubt he undermined it; for no one has ever insulted natural
human feelings with impunity. His idea was conformity at any price,
subordination of the people to the clergy, subordination of these
latter to their own chiefs, and of all to the King.</p>

<p>It is not quite clear whether he consciously cherished the design which
is attributed to him of expanding the archbishopric of Canterbury into
a patriarchate of the British Islands, and of holding this dignity
himself: but his efforts aimed without any disguise at giving the
episcopal system and the usages of the Anglican Church the supremacy in
the other two kingdoms as well as in England.</p>

<p>We know how zealously James I had struggled to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1634.</span> this end in Scotland; and we shall soon see what further
advances were made on his footsteps. In England itself conformity of
all individuals, in Scotland conformity with English institutions, was
the most prominent motive of everything which was done in regard to the
Church. In Ireland also the same attempt was made.</p>

<p>When colonies were established in Ireland, in which many Scots took
part, articles for the Irish Church, which might satisfy the Scots
as well as the English, were accepted in that country. They were
introduced by James Usher, who at that time was Provost of Trinity
College, Dublin, and afterwards Archbishop of Armagh, Primate of
Ireland. But little was said in them of the necessity of the episcopal
constitution, although it was retained. The difference between
presbyters and bishops was passed over in silence. The Pope, after the
example of the Synod of Gap, was termed Antichrist: the observance
of Sunday as though it were the Jewish sabbath was ordained; and
many distinctive Calvinistic tenets were accepted. King James, it
is true, once called Doctor Usher to account for this; but at all
events he confirmed the articles just at the time when he himself
was maintaining strict Calvinistic opinions, owing to his connexion
with the Prince of Orange. Now however under Charles I these opinions
were no longer to be tolerated; for the King felt that the variety of
Protestant opinions was a scandal in the eyes of the Irish Catholics,
and that their conversion was hindered by the violence of the contrast
presented by Calvinism. And it is evident that the consolidation of
perhaps the most zealous adherents whom the Pope had in the world
into one single state, such as Charles I contemplated, with those who
declared him to be Antichrist, was impossible. Consistently with the
prevailing policy, the Lord Deputy, Thomas Wentworth, in the Parliament
of 1634 undertook to procure the abrogation of the Irish articles in
substance if not in form. The Lower House of the Convocation of the
Irish Protestant Church made the canon law of the English Church the
subject of free discussion, and a committee of Convocation had already
framed a canon which insisted on the maintenance of the Irish articles,
even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1634.</span> under pain of excommunication. Wentworth
regarded this as a sort of revolt. In severe language he pointed out to
the Convocation its presumption and want of subordination in wishing
to pronounce judgment on laws of the English Church. He himself drew
up a canon, in which assent to the Thirty-nine Articles in general was
promised. The Archbishop of Armagh, who could not act inconsistently
with his former behaviour, but at the same time could not resist the
plans of the government, proposed a less stringent form: but Wentworth
insisted upon his canon, and had the pleasure of seeing it carried in
Convocation almost without opposition, in the very form in which he
had drawn it up; for the members were one and all enchained by his
sovereign will. This is perhaps the last canon drawn up for the Irish
Church as such, which was thus inseparably united with the English<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.
Wentworth gave Archbishop Laud triumphant tidings of his unexpected
success.</p>


<h3 id="FURTHER_DESIGNS"><i>Further designs of the Government.</i></h3>

<p>The Irish Parliament, which stood side by side with this Convocation,
was the same which made the general administration of Wentworth famous.
It was composed partly of Catholics and partly of Protestants; for
his main object was to unite both creeds in one community: but in
disputed questions the Protestants had the preponderance, and among the
Protestants the Anglicans. In the Upper House the bishops as a rule
had the decision in their own hands. Parliament was induced to grant
supplies by which a well-ordered government of the country was for the
first time rendered possible.</p>

<p>What a vital union is here displayed between the elements of spiritual
and temporal obedience! Wentworth adds to the information above
mentioned the remark, that in Ireland the King was as absolute as any
other sovereign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> in his own country, provided
only that he had as his representative a man of insight and loyalty,
whose hands were not tied. The Lord Deputy can be as little accused as
the King or the Archbishop of wishing to pave the way for Catholicism:
Wentworth was known as a very staunch Protestant. Their thoughts were
only directed to the development of Anglicanism expressed in its most
rigid form, and administered without indulgence. What James I had
already intended and attempted to carry out, but with vacillation and
with fresh concessions to the other side, Charles I and his statesmen
undertook in earnest. They wished to make episcopacy one of the chief
foundations of the monarchy.</p>

<p>Did they entertain the thought of sweeping away the English Parliament
altogether, or at least of not calling it together again? This is not
likely. King Charles affirmed on more than one occasion that it lay
with him to summon or not to summon Parliament, and a resolution had
been formed to issue no fresh summons as long as the royal authority
was not firmly established on its own foundation. The Archbishop once
said at a later time, that Parliament was intended to maintain the
power and greatness of the crown, but that nothing in the world was
more lamentable than the corruption of what was good: that Parliament
had once ventured to depose a king, but that it never ought to be
allowed to proceed to this length again: that for his part he had
never thought of setting aside Parliamentary government; though he had
perhaps thought it right, in cases of urgent necessity, to collect
taxes which had not been granted by Parliament.</p>

<p>We become still more accurately acquainted with the direction in which
affairs were moving, through a letter from Wentworth to the King.
After the miscarriage of Arundel’s mission, much was said of the
expediency of again forming a connexion between England and France and
the States-General, of imposing certain conditions on the Spaniards,
and then exacting their performance even by force of arms. Wentworth
declared himself most decidedly opposed to the scheme, and that not
only because he preferred the alliance of Spain to that of France on
general grounds, but most of all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> as he states
at full length, because the power of the King was not sufficiently
confirmed in Ireland, much less in England, to allow him to interfere
decisively in European affairs. Whatever weight might attach to the
declaration of the courts of justice that the King was entitled to
levy ship-money, yet he considered this decision far from sufficient.
If a war were to break out, he thought that the tax would be refused,
and that the government would have less power to exact it: what would
happen then if any disaster occurred? It would certainly be necessary
in that case to summon Parliament, and to claim its assistance—a
course which under the present circumstances no one could wish to
adopt. So long as it had not been decided that the King had the same
right to raise an army which he now enjoyed with regard to the navy,
Wentworth thought that his authority had only one foot, and that he
must be put in a position to raise forces for service on land, which he
could lead into foreign countries according to his own judgment, like
the old kings of England; that this state of things must be brought
about first in England, and then step by step in Scotland; and that
till then the goal could not be reached, and no great undertaking could
be hazarded<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p>On principle Wentworth was as little opposed to a Parliament in England
as in Ireland; but he wished to have only such a Parliament as would be
subservient. He thought of making the government and the royal power
independent of grants of Parliament in great affairs, such as peace
and war and foreign enterprises generally. The King was no longer, as
in the late sessions, to be compelled to make concessions in order
to maintain his proper position in European affairs. His immediate
intention was to uphold the decision of the Judges with regard to the
payment of ship-money, and to obtain a similar authorisation in regard
to the support of the army.</p>

<p>It is apparent however what would have been the significance of such a
decision. The political importance of Parliament had arisen from the
power of granting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1635.</span> money required for the
purposes of war: if the latter were taken away, how could the former
endure? The King had not only an acknowledged right of judging whether
the kingdom was in danger, but it was laid down as his duty to forestal
such a contingency. If he were now authorised to call out the military
and naval forces of the kingdom in case he thought fit, how could he
be refused the needful resources for keeping them up when called out?
Parliament would have played a very inferior part; and, in England as
on the Continent, the monarchy would have taken the form of a military
administration.</p>


<h3 id="PUBLIC_AFFAIRS"><i>Public Affairs.</i></h3>

<p>Among the King’s advisers there was no lack of men of ability to
connect the ascendancy of the monarchy with the great interests of the
country and with their furtherance.</p>

<p>Wentworth bequeathed to the Irish no contemptible monument of his
autocratic sway. He founded their linen manufacture, in the first
instance at his own expense, with the definite expectation that it
would form an inexhaustible source of wealth for the country<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, just
as wool and woollen manufactures were for England.</p>

<p>The English had their factories at Alexandria, Aleppo, and
Constantinople, as well as in Persia and India: for their cloth was in
request all over the East. Among the motives in Charles I’s mind for
entering on friendly relations with the Pope, one was the intention of
opening the harbour of Civita Vecchia to his subjects.</p>

<p>The arrangement concluded with Spain was of immense value for commerce,
which was carried on in a very peculiar manner during the continuance
of the general war. The Spaniards sent their gold and silver to
England, from which country their payments could be made in Flanders
and Germany through the bills of English houses which enjoyed good
credit on the continent. The precious metals were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1635.</span> sent from Spain in bars: the English crown thus gained the
advantage of coining them. The transport of goods, and even of the
necessaries of war, between Spain and the Netherlands, was carried on
in English merchantmen, or under English escort. The Portuguese kept up
their intercourse with their American colonies under the English flag,
which assured them against the attacks of the Dutch; and they were glad
to hire English ships, which were better armed than their own<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p>The construction of the English vessels aroused the admiration of
experts: the ships of the East India Company by their solidity and
their provision for every possible requirement, appeared to carry off
the palm from all others.</p>

<p>As the King’s policy contributed to the extension of commerce, so the
religious disputes contributed to the extension of the colonies. To
those who would not submit to Laud’s ordinances New England offered
a refuge: we shall return to the circumstances under which the
colonies were planted there. But even for the toleration of Catholics
in England there was no legal security. The first attempt at an
ecclesiastical order of things, in which Episcopalianism came to terms
with Catholicism on fixed principles, was made on the other side of the
Atlantic, in Maryland. This may be the reason why this colony received
a constitution that was to a great extent independent of the mother
country. Maryland was peculiarly the creation of Charles I: the name
it bears is derived from the Queen of that sovereign. A scheme was
entertained at that time of colonising Madagascar in the interest of a
Palatine prince.</p>

<p>As yet the colonies had no towns: London was the market to which they
resorted for their supplies, and for the sale of their products: under
these circumstances she began to be the emporium of the general trade
of the world.</p>

<p>The cultivation of English commerce was almost a matter of personal
care with the King. Not only the administration of his state, but even
the maintenance of his court, rested upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span>
the proceeds of the customs; and the court was still suitably and
brilliantly kept up<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. And however little Charles may have thought of
endangering the repose of his kingdom for the sake of the Palatinate,
yet he had never been loath to provide for the necessities of his
sister and nephews.</p>

<p>But besides this he loved to support literature and art. He directly
offended the scruples of the Puritans by attending the theatre. A
splendid and costly masquerade, which the four Inns of Court combined
to exhibit in the Carnival of the year 1633, was counted as a proof
of their loyalty. They drove from Ely House through Chancery Lane
and Whitehall in their carriages surrounded by torches; and the King
sent to request them to take a route that would enable him to see the
spectacle twice. The ladies and gentlemen of the court mustered in
their richest dress, and later in the evening the Queen mingled with
the dancers. Shirley, who was in the Queen’s service, Massinger, and
old Ben Jonson still prevented the English stage from degenerating:
Cymbeline, Richard III, and other plays of Shakespeare were favourite
pieces with the public. Ben Jonson lived till 1637: from time to time
he had the opportunity of celebrating the generosity of Charles I,
of which he was greatly in need. In his later writings, such as his
‘Discoveries made upon Men and Matter,’ a ripe and lively feeling for
literary culture and for culture generally is displayed which does
honour to the age.</p>

<p>Charles I developed not only a preference, but a real appreciation,
for art. Inigo Jones, whom many consider as the man of the greatest
artistic talent whom England on the whole has produced, and in whose
works we perceive a steady progress from an overcharged romantic style
to purer forms, was one of his personal friends. It is easy to see why
a man of architectural genius should attach himself to the court, for
which he built chapels and banqueting halls, and to Archbishop Laud,
who undertook to restore churches in the style of Christian antiquity,
rather than to the Puritans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> who looked for
salvation in the bare gospel. Among the King’s servants we find
Vandyke, who in his incomparable portraits has preserved for us the
forms of those who moved in high society; and Rubens, who reconciled
his political commissions with constant practice of his art. On him as
on others the obstinacy of the popular resistance with which Charles
came into collision in his last Parliament produced an unfavourable
impression. He blames the learned Selden for getting him involved in
this confusion, to the prejudice of his art<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. But as for the rest
he was astonished by the zeal for study displayed by the English, and
by the richness of their collections of works of art. The Arundel
marbles were already rousing the attention of students of antiquity:
Kenelm Digby procured for the King himself some of the finest monuments
of ancient Greek art from the Levant. From Italy and Spain there was
brought to him, as one of his contemporaries says, a whole troop of
emperors and senators of ancient Rome, which he himself took pains to
arrange in their chronological order: and he was capable of showing
impatience if any one disturbed him in his task. He may be regarded as
one of the best connoisseurs of art that has ever sat on a throne: he
was able after short consideration to distinguish with delicate and
certain judgment between those Italian masters who are closely allied
in style and touch. There was no surer road to his favour than bringing
him a picture of some celebrated master as a present, or pointing one
out for purchase, which could still be effected with remarkable ease.
The catalogues of his property show nine Correggios, thirteen Raphaels,
forty-five Titians—among which are some of the greatest works of these
masters, such as ‘The Education of Love,’ by the first; ‘The Holy
Family,’ known under the name of ‘The Pearl,’ by the second; and among
others by the third, ‘The Venus of the Prado.’ These catalogues present
a many-sided interest in the history of art: they enumerate 400 works
in sculpture, and 1400 in painting. Inigo Jones built a gallery for
them: the King wished to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span> have the principal works about him in his
chambers at Oatlands, Hampton Court, St. James’s and Whitehall<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
In the gardens of York House he put up the figures of Cain and Abel,
by John of Bologna, the imitator of Michael Angelo, one of the finest
groups by that master, a present from Philip IV of Spain. It was the
intention of Charles I to adorn the squares and public gardens of
London in general with works of artistic merit.</p>

<p>It is worth while to remark the connexion between these efforts in
favour of art and poetry, and the social cultivation, the general
tendencies in favour of toleration, of ecclesiastical ceremony, and of
antiquity, and the cosmopolitan sympathies, which mark the ascendancy
of royal authority. Could Charles I ever have succeeded in leading
the English mind in this direction, and in instigating it to produce
works of its own? We may feel ourselves tempted to agree with those who
have at all times made it the bitterest reproach of the Puritans, that
they opposed these intentions, and even frustrated them. But in the
struggles between different tendencies, which give the tone to an age,
the question in dispute cannot be settled by the encouragement which
they afford to this or that branch of culture. They are like the forces
of nature, which create but at the same time destroy. The other party
also had its rights, its ideas, and, if we regard the general state
of the world and of the time, a still greater destiny in the field of
universal history.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="small">CONFLICTING TENDENCIES OF THE AGE AND WITHIN THE KINGDOM OF GREAT
BRITAIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If we adhere to the view that the Latin and Teutonic nations, in the
development which they have reached under the influence of the Western
Church, make up a great indivisible community which furthermore appears
as an unit in the world; and if we further look for the characteristic
features by which this system of nations is distinguished from all
other growths of worldwide historical importance, we find that they
are principally two; the close connexion between Church and State
involving a constant struggle between these two principles; and next
the mixture of monarchical with representative institutions in each
single country and the internal conflicts thence arising. At times
republican formations made their appearance; yet they were hardly able
to emancipate themselves from aristocratic and even from monarchical
forms. At times absolute monarchy obtained the upper hand; but, if we
consider the governments which are most conspicuous in this respect,
we find that the supreme will of the sovereign was hardly ever able
to prevail over the great obstacles presented by provinces and
individuals. So there have been centuries in which the great monarchies
appear to have been broken up or oppressed by the hierarchy: but even
the Papacy met with opposition; the authority of those self-same
popular bodies, which were perhaps originally allied with it, in later
times was opposed to it. The characteristic life of the West, the
continuity of its development, and its ascendancy in the world, are
due to this conflict between ecclesiastical and political influences,
between the tendencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> towards monarchical and
those towards representative government, and to the mutual action of
independent nationalities, within an unity which embraced all, but yet
was never complete, and was rather ideal than actually realised.</p>

<p>The great secession from Rome which came to pass in the sixteenth
century did not break up this system of nations. The more remote
were brought at times into closer relations with one another by the
universal opposition and struggle, which in turn very materially
affected the shapes into which the domestic relations of the individual
states were thrown.</p>

<p>If Protestantism contributed to strengthen the power of the sovereigns
under whose lead it was carried out, yet the temporal estates also
shared the gain which accrued from the defeat and curtailment of
ecclesiastical interests; for by this means their own power became
more firmly established. The restoration of Catholicism at a later
period had a very different effect. The concessions which the Papacy
voluntarily made to secure it, redounded mainly to the advantage
of the sovereigns. The Popes themselves, in order to revive their
ecclesiastical authority in every country, employed all the pecuniary
resources which could in any way be raised in their newly conquered
state, which now for the first time was entirely reduced to obedience.
In Italy they created for themselves a new Grand Duchy, by the erection
of which the rights of the municipalities comprised within it were
entirely destroyed. The Spanish monarchy, which in this epoch played
the most important part, had not, it is true, annihilated, but had kept
down the independence of the provinces in the Italian as well as in the
Spanish peninsula, which in earlier times had been so powerful; and as
by the aid of American gold it had obtained a power independent of the
good will of the Estates, the authority of the sovereign was asserted
far and wide. These two agencies reacted most powerfully upon Germany.
Even before the Thirty Years’ War the territories of the ecclesiastical
and Catholic princes followed the example of Rome. During the war,
and by means of it, the house of Austria brought into subjection the
representative constitution of the kingdoms and countries belonging to
it which had attached themselves to the principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1637.</span> of Protestantism. Frederick Elector Palatine stood at the head
of these independent bodies, but they did not understand how to support
him effectively. They fell with him. The same thing then happened
in the central districts of Germany, where the combinations between
sovereigns and estates were so weak from their rivalry with one another
that they went to ruin.</p>

<p>In France Catholicism had once helped the Estates in their struggle
against the monarch, but this alliance could not be maintained. After
the hereditary sovereign had reached throne by the going over to
Catholicism, he still based his authority upon the maintenance of an
equilibrium between the two religious parties. But for his successors
this policy was no longer necessary. The Catholic portion of their
subjects attached themselves to them without any regard to a title
conferred by the Estates; and though the magnates then sought for
safety principally in an alliance with Protestant interests, the result
was that ecclesiastical and political independence sustained a common
defeat at the hands of the sovereign and of the Catholic party. The
power of the state assumed a deeper Catholic colour the more it aimed
at absolutism.</p>

<p>The principle of monarchy combined with Catholicism now appeared
in different forms in three great kingdoms. In that of Spain it
was intolerant of Protestantism, but was surrounded by provincial
assemblies of estates, whose action, although subdued, was not
altogether annihilated: in the French monarchy it appeared more
tolerant of the Protestants even on its own ground, but was master of
the Estates, which just at this period were completely subdued: in the
Austrian monarchy it was intolerant both towards the Protestants who
were persecuted and ejected, and towards the Estates which had just
been conquered. The struggle which had broken out between France on the
one side, and Spain combined with Austria on the other, caused the two
latter kingdoms to adopt, or at least to try to adopt, the principle
of unity under an absolute monarch which had been carried out in the
former. There is a very peculiar difference in the relations of the
three powers with the German Protestants, who were saved from utter
ruin by the intervention of the King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> of Sweden.
The French sought to make the Protestant Estates of the Empire as
independent as possible of Austria: Spain at that time was willing to
tolerate their faith, but wished to bring them back under the control
of the Emperor: at the Imperial court itself there was a tendency
prevailing, at least for a time, to suppress both their belief and
their independence.</p>

<p>Thus the Western world at this epoch was pervaded by a threefold
hostility: by the religious dispute between the two great parties, in
which the Catholic party had obtained an immeasurable superiority: by
the great opposition in regard to foreign policy between France and the
Austro-Spanish power; and by a third antagonism in regard to domestic
affairs. The monarchical had become more than ever supreme over the
constitutional principle.</p>

<p>Let us now sum up the position which England under the Stuarts occupied
in these great questions.</p>

<p>From the posterity of Mary Stuart, who at the same time were the
successors of Queen Elizabeth, and to whom the alliances of both
queens descended, nothing else could be expected than that they should
interfere but little in the religious struggles of the continent. They
sought to keep on good terms, and even in alliance with both parties.
They had certainly been implicated in the great struggle by the affair
of the Palatinate: Charles I had on one occasion even taken up a
position at the head of the Protestant party; but he had suffered a
defeat in that character. This connexion had even turned out ruinous
to the Protestants: henceforward he left them to shift for themselves
as far as the principal question was concerned, and followed only his
private end, the restoration of his nephew, the Elector Palatine.</p>

<p>In his disputes with the two great continental powers, James I had
carried out still further the policy for which Elizabeth had paved the
way. He had contributed to the emancipation of the Republic of the
Netherlands from Spain, for the ascendancy of this monarchy by land and
sea was obnoxious to James himself. But he would go no further. It was
altogether contrary to his wish and intention that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1637.</span> was involved at the end of his days in a quarrel with Spain.
As in the religious, so also in the political conflict, the Stuarts
did not wish, properly speaking, to take the side either of France
or Spain. From this radical tendency of their policy they sometimes
deviated, but always returned to it again.</p>

<p>In both those great questions in fine which decided the future of the
world, Charles I, after his interference had once resulted in failure,
no longer took a pronounced and independent part. We saw what was the
issue of his wish to be the ally at the same time of Sweden and of
Spain. In domestic affairs on the contrary he had fixed his eyes upon
a definite aim. Here, although the questions which were agitated might
be altogether native to the English soil and atmosphere, his policy
had some analogy with that which prevailed on the continent. He also,
like the great Catholic sovereigns, sought to crush the pretensions of
the Estates in political affairs; and he, like them, endeavoured to
strengthen the royal power by means of the attributes of the spiritual.</p>

<p>It was not that Charles I had thought of subjecting himself to the
Papacy. We know how far his soul was averse to this: he could not
come to an understanding with the Pope even about the formula in
which the Catholics were to promise their obedience, in order to make
their toleration possible for him. The English crown could not be
strengthened, as was the case with other powers, by encouraging the
ideas of Catholicism: on the contrary, it was rather supported by the
authority which it had wrested from the Papacy. The royal supremacy
over the Church was intended, by means of the closest alliance with
the Protestant bishops, to become, in the hands of the supreme power,
a weapon which should be employed in all three kingdoms. The bishops
were confirmed in their possessions and dignity; moreover the common
opposition to their opponents, who had been hated by the Stuarts before
they left Scotland, united the bishops as closely as possible with
the sovereign, whose cause they defended as their own. When the crown
found that its interest lay in sparing the Catholics and suppressing
the Puritans, an extraordinary effect followed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span>
the ecclesiastical power which had grown out of the Reformation proved
more favourable to the adherents of the old creed than to the zealous
champions of the new.</p>

<p>This was completely in harmony with the position of the Stuarts when
they received their crown. They wished to be Protestants, but to
avoid the hostility of the Catholics and, if possible, to annihilate
Puritanism. Their relation with the Episcopal Church was on the whole
the same with that which Elizabeth had established; but it differed
from it, inasmuch as the Queen persecuted the Catholics with decided
hostility and tolerated the Presbyterians as her indispensable allies
in this conflict, while the Stuarts hated the Presbyterians, and wished
to grant toleration to the Catholics.</p>

<p>The hereditary right of the Stuarts, which was acknowledged by both
religious parties, had been the ground of the union between Scotland
and England, and of the greater obedience of Ireland: it was therefore
natural that the Parliaments should appear to these monarchs to be
subordinate provincial bodies, which had only a limited influence on
the government of the whole monarchy. They thought themselves fully
warranted in enforcing the rights which the monarchy derived either
from the abstract idea they had formed of it, or from the customs of
their predecessors, without regard to the Parliaments. They regarded
them as assemblies of counsellors which they might consult or not at
their discretion, and whose duty it was to support the crown, without
the right of dictating to it in any way, or of obstructing it in its
movements.</p>

<p>The whole system arose out of the views, experiences, and intentions
which James I brought with him to the English throne. But this
sovereign was as skilful in practice as he was aspiring in theory.
Incessant oscillation between opposite parties had in him become
a second nature. He avoided driving the adversaries with whom he
contended to desperation: he never pushed matters to an extremity.
He never lost sight of his end for a moment, but he sought to effect
his designs if necessary by circuitous paths, and by means of clever
and pliant tools; he had no scruple about sacrificing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1637.</span> any one who did not serve his purpose. Charles I deemed
it important to avoid this vacillation. He loved to be served by
men of decided tone and colour, and thought it a point of honour to
maintain them against all assaults. He adhered without wavering to
those maxims and theories which he had received from his father, and
which he considered as an heirloom. He always threw himself directly
upon the object immediately before him. In the world which surrounded
him, Charles I always passed for a man without a fault, who committed
no excesses, had no vices, possessed cultivation and knowledge to the
fullest extent, without wishing to make a show in consequence: not
indeed by nature devoid of severity, which however he tempered with
feelings of humanity;—for instance, he could hardly be brought to
sign a sentence of death. Since the death of Buckingham he appeared
to choose his ministers by merit and capacity, and no longer by
favouritism: even his queen seemed to exercise no political influence
over him. But this calm, artistic, religious sovereign, certainly did
not add to his qualities the cleverness which marked the administration
of his father. James could never be really affronted: he put up with
everything which he could not alter. Charles I had a very lively
and irritable sense of personal honour: he was easily wounded and
sought to revenge himself; and then perhaps he committed himself to
enterprises, the scope of which he did not perceive. He wanted that
general sense of the state of affairs which distinguishes what is
attainable from what is not. He prosecuted the quarrels in which he
was involved as zealously and as long as possible, and then suddenly
renounced them. People compared him to a miser, who turns over every
penny, as we say, before he parts with it, but then suddenly throws
away a large sum. Yet still when Charles I made concessions, he never
made them unconditionally. This trustworthy man could bring himself to
balance the promises he made in public by a secret reservation which
absolved him from them again. With Charles I nothing was more seductive
than secrecy. The contradictions in his conduct entangled him in
embarrassments, in which his declarations, if always true in the sense
he privately gave them, were only a hair’s-breadth removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1637.</span> from actual and even from intentional untruth. His method
of governing the State was in itself of an equivocal character,
inasmuch as he declared that he wished to uphold the laws of England,
and then notwithstanding made dispositions which rested on obsolete
rights and ran counter to what all the world deemed lawful: he affirmed
that he did not wish to encroach upon Parliamentary government, and
then nevertheless did everything to relieve himself for a long period
from the necessity of summoning Parliament. Notwithstanding all the
forbearance from shedding human blood which he had imposed on himself,
yet he had the severest punishment inflicted upon the opponents of his
system, by which even their lives were endangered. For his political
aim outweighed all other considerations, and he did not hesitate to
employ any means to attain it.</p>

<p>The system of Charles I consisted in making the royal prerogative
the basis of government. He had no military forces however which he
could employ to secure that object, such as at this time were used in
France to maintain the supreme authority: on the contrary, foreigners
were surprised to see how completely the King was in the hands of his
people; that there were hardly any fortresses to which he could fly
for safety in time of need; that everything depended on the laws and
their interpretation. This was just what gave importance to the fact
that some of the heads of the judicial body, and those too the very
men who had formerly belonged to the Parliamentary party, such as Noy
and Littleton, now became champions of the prerogative. Their change
may have been due to altered convictions and lawyer-like attachment
to one side, as there was much found in the laws which could be urged
in favour of their present view; or it may have arisen from slavish
ambition, animated by the desire to obtain the highest offices. Many
persons in England as well as in France, and with the same zeal which
was shown in that country, espoused the idea of the sovereignty of
the crown; they thought that it was older than all Parliaments, and
was acknowledged in the laws. From the duty of defending and ruling
the kingdom they inferred the right of the King to demand from his
subjects the means of fulfilling that duty. All the provisions of
Magna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> Charta, or of the laws of Edward I to
the contrary, or the doctrines of law-books, which in fact contained
much that was indefinite and dependent upon the circumstances of the
time, were of no account in their eyes in comparison with this right.
And while the advocates of these views thus had a position which
could be regarded as legal, the administration had already found in
the Lord Deputy of Ireland a man who had the will and the capacity
to develop government by prerogative to its full proportions. And
the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had never wavered for a moment,
so conducted the government of the Church as to uphold the King’s
prerogative of supremacy in ecclesiastical affairs. He appeared to
aim at establishing, or rather, properly speaking, already to possess
in substance a British patriarchate, such as that which long ago in
Constantinople had stood beside the throne of the Greek emperors,
and had promoted their views. Although different in procedure, and
in the foundation on which they rested, these efforts had a general
coincidence with the policy which was being carried out in other
great monarchies in the name of the sovereign by ambitious ministers,
obsequious tribunals, and devoted bishops. Where in England was the
power which could have resisted it? In order to realise the dull
dissatisfaction and the despair of the mother-country which was
spreading in consequence, we must recollect that the colonisation
of New England was due to emigration from English shores. Even at
an earlier time a troop of exiled believers, who termed themselves
pilgrims, and who in fact were seeking a refuge in Virginia, had
been driven further north, where they founded New Plymouth. After
existing for ten years, the colony reckoned no more than three hundred
members, and it still lacked legal recognition. But the increasing
ecclesiastical oppression which prevailed in England now impelled a
number of families of some property and position in Suffolk, Rutland,
Lincolnshire, and Northamptonshire, to turn their steps in the same
direction. Their principal object was to erect a bulwark in these
distant regions against the kingdom of Antichrist, which was being
extended by the Jesuits<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. For they thought that they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1637.</span> to fear lest the English Church also should fall a victim
to the ruin which had overtaken so many others. How much better, they
imagined, would the faithful in the Palatinate and in Rochelle have
done, if they had seized the right moment to secure an asylum for the
exercise of their religion on the other side of the ocean! That country
in which they could best serve God seemed to them their fatherland.
As it conduced to their safety that they should not cross the sea as
fugitives without rights, they obtained for themselves a transfer of
Massachusetts Bay and the neighbouring territory, drawn up according to
the forms of English law. But even this was not enough to satisfy them,
for they did not wish to be governed from England, after the fashion of
other colonies. They did not decide on transplanting themselves until
they had received by charter the right of transferring the government
of the colony to the other continent. John Winthrop, if not in wealth,
in which some others surpassed him, yet in descent and position the
most distinguished among those who conducted the enterprise was the
first governor of the society and of the colony. In the year 1630
the emigrants, numbering about 1500, crossed to America in seventeen
ships, sailing from different ports. But year by year other expeditions
followed them<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. For on this side of the water the pre-eminence
accorded to the English Church was constantly becoming more decided,
while on that side Presbyterianism, in the strict form in which it
was now embodied, had free scope. In the year 1638 the colonists were
reckoned at 50,000, and they had already established a number of
settlements in the country.</p>

<p>And this colony even then appeared a place of refuge for political
exiles. We must certainly reject as unfounded what has been so often
related and repeated, that Hampden and Pym were hindered by the
government itself from going to America: but it is true that they had
entertained the thought of going. Their names are found on the list of
those to whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> the Earl of Warwick assigned as a
settlement a large tract of coast which he had acquired<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<p>The catalogue of these names is also remarkable in other ways. We find
on it the names of Lord Brook, and of Lord Say and Seale, who, like the
Earl of Warwick himself, were among those members of the aristocracy
who offered the most decided opposition to the designs of Charles I
and of his ministers. They passed for opponents of Weston and of the
Spaniards, and for friends of Holland and even of France. Another
special bond of union was the Presbyterian interest which was, as it
were, the element in which the colony lived and moved. Lord Warwick,
one of the largest proprietors in England and America, was one of the
principal patrons of the colony. His mother’s name is conspicuous among
those of the benefactors of the new plantation.</p>

<p>But the nobility in general were by no means upon the side of the King.
Their influence indeed had been already felt in the attacks directed
by the Lower House against the rising power of Buckingham. If the King
abstained from convening another Parliament, they would thus lose the
principal influence upon public affairs which they possessed. The
English aristocracy did not share the fiery impulses of the French;
as it did not at once rise in insurrection, it did not incur those
chastisements for disobedience with which the other was visited by an
inaccessible power in the State. It waited for a convenient season to
come forward.</p>

<p>Like the great nobles, and even in a higher degree than they, the
landed gentry felt themselves threatened and endangered by the revival
of laws which had fallen into abeyance, and claims to rights which had
been forgotten. The extension of the forest-laws was effected without
their participation by juries of foresters, wood-rangers, and other
persons interested in the advantages which were to be expected from
such an extension: their verdict was afterwards confirmed by judges
discredited by the suspicion of partiality.</p>

<p>The displeasure of other circles was roused by the degrading penalties
which the ecclesiastical courts inflicted on men of no mean position.
Very few might find pleasure in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> Prynne’s attack
upon the drama; but to crop his ears for some words which referred
to the Queen appeared an affront to his University degree and to the
barrister’s robe which he wore.</p>

<p>And how deeply was public feeling humiliated when the sentence of the
judges followed affirming the royal claim to ship-money: men were
seen passing one another in silence with gloomy looks. Even those
who did not grudge the King a new source of revenue, and esteemed it
necessary, were yet alarmed that it could be assured to him without
grant of Parliament. The doubtful legality, to say the least of it,
of this proceeding inspired anxiety lest the untrustworthy, morally
contemptible and covetous men who contended for the claims of the
crown, should become masters of the government, without any possible
expectation of a Parliament to instil into them some fear and respect.</p>

<p>Such however was now the condition of affairs: no one had a position
which enabled him to raise his voice to remonstrate; and any free
expression of opinion involved the extremest danger. The authority
of the Church and of the judges, supporting itself on its own
interpretation of the laws, now governed England. This system was
extending itself over Scotland by the agency of the friends and
adherents of Laud: in Ireland a resolute will drew the reins as tight
as possible. It seemed likely in fact that the union of monarchical and
ecclesiastical power, which prevailed in the rest of the Teutonic and
Latin world, would also take possession of England, and would thus gain
a complete ascendancy.</p>

<p>The foreign policy of England was fairly in keeping with these
tendencies in domestic affairs. The great Anglicans and champions
of the prerogative showed little ardour for the cause of European
Protestantism. On the other hand the adherents of Parliament, and the
Nonconformists, regarded the cause of this creed as almost identical
with their own:—opposite views which were found even at court, but
threw the nation most of all into confusion, and were the main cause
why the efforts of the King encountered a resistance which by degrees
proved insuperable.</p>

<p>The great struggle began in Scotland.</p>

<span class="small">ORIGIN AND OUTBREAK OF ECCLESIASTICAL DISTURBANCES IN SCOTLAND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Not one of the governments of Protestant countries had had so little
share in carrying out the reform of the Church as that of Scotland.
The change had taken place in opposition to Mary Stuart, or the
representatives of her rights. James I had accepted it, so far as
doctrine was concerned; but he had from the first shown a dislike for
the ecclesiastical constitution in which it was embodied.</p>

<p>His ancestors had always found support in their connexion with the
hierarchy; and in the same way we have noticed that this prince,
induced in the first instance by the relations of the different
elements in the state, had sought to restore episcopacy. Political
reasons were supported by considerations of a strictly religious
character, but above all by the example of England. The establishment
of episcopacy appeared to him the principal step towards effecting the
union of both countries: he regarded it as one of the great tasks of
his life.</p>

<p>Properly speaking the revival of episcopacy passed through two
different stages of development during his reign.</p>

<p>So long as George Gladstane was Archbishop of St. Andrews (1607-1615),
the Scottish episcopate remained pretty nearly what it was originally
intended to be—a superintending body such as had previously existed.
Gladstane showed great indulgence in the exercise of his archiepiscopal
rights themselves. He tolerated everywhere the ecclesiastical usages
which had been imported from Geneva, and which allowed much freedom
to the minister. Among learned theologians a school was developed,
principally by Cameron’s action in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1618.</span> opposition
to Melville, which reconciled itself to the episcopal system in this
shape, and many ministers adhered to it. A sensible addition was
made to the strength of Anglican and episcopal tendencies when, in
the year 1615, John Spottiswood became Archbishop of St. Andrews,
and thereby primate and metropolitan of the Scottish Church: he was
one of the three bishops who had received their episcopal ordination
from English bishops, and had in consequence espoused the theory of
apostolical succession. Even Spottiswood did not go so far as to wish
to take the legislative power of the Scottish Church out of the hands
of the General Assembly of the clergy: on the contrary he himself, in
conferring with the King, opposed a scheme of legislation which aimed
at this object; but, while he reserved the rights of the Assembly,
he thought himself justified in using it to promote the reception
of episcopal authority, and to bring about a nearer approach to the
Anglican system. In this he sided with the King, even if he was
personally not convinced of the necessity of a change. He cherished the
opinion that obedience must be shown to the King in everything which
was not in contradiction to the faith; and he asserted this principle
in the Assembly of Perth in the year 1618, with such success that
the King’s proposals were accepted by a considerable majority. These
proposals were embodied in the decrees known under the name of the
Five Articles of Perth. They decided various points, among which the
practice of kneeling at the reception of the Lord’s Supper, and the
observance of high festivals were the most important.</p>

<p>But whilst the Archbishop satisfied the King, he provoked the hostility
of those zealous Presbyterians who looked upon the conclusions of the
Assembly, which they affirmed to have been this time influenced by the
bishops, as a falling away from former laws, and were ready to urge
many objections to them on the ground of doctrine. The practice of
kneeling at the reception of the Lord’s Supper was objected to by them,
because no mention was made of it in the words of institution. They met
the demand that they should observe high feast-days with the assertion
that they contained points of agreement with heathenism; as for
instance Christmas Day was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1627.</span> only another form of
the Norse Yule Feast<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>: and they laid the greatest stress on keeping
Sunday strictly as the Sabbath. The rest of the Articles of Perth were
almost entirely disregarded, and these two, the most important of them,
were very imperfectly carried out<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>The distinction between active and passive resistance in regard to the
will of the sovereign, which appears at this moment, is significant of
the state of affairs. The ministers did not wish to resist the King,
for they were still doubtful whether such conduct was reconcilable
with the Divine commands; but they refused on their part to follow
ordinances which they deemed unlawful and inconsistent with the
established religion. This obedience which they refused would be active
obedience: merely to abstain from resisting they also considered
obedience, and this they denominated passive obedience, and believed
that they might satisfy their duty by paying it<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>James I had no desire to go further, and resisted the demands of those
who urged him to do so; for, as he said, he knew his people, and did
not wish to fall out with them as his mother had done.</p>

<p>In the first years of his reign Charles I also allowed toleration
to prevail. When the preachers who had been appointed before the
introduction of the Articles of Perth neglected to obey them, he
overlooked their omission. The affairs of the Scottish Church were left
in the hands of Spottiswood, who, in spite of all counter-influences,
conducted them peacefully, with foresight, and with a certain
moderation. But when, after the conclusion of peace with France and
Spain, the system of combining ecclesiastical with political authority
began to prevail in England, affairs assumed another aspect in Scotland
as well. The vacant bishoprics, which had hitherto been filled up
according to the recommendation of the Scottish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span>
bishops, were now disposed of according to the wishes of William Laud,
whom the King made his counsellor in the affairs of the Scottish
Church as well as of the English. He, however, selected young men
who concurred with him in his hierarchical and theological opinions.
A new system, the Laudian, later indeed also called the Canterbury
system, found acceptance in regard to the constitution and dogmas of
the Church. General assemblies of the Church were as carefully avoided
in Scotland, as Parliaments in England; and that with the definite
object of concentrating ecclesiastical power entirely in the hands
of the bishops, on which subject the testimony of the early Church
was collected and put forward. At the same time favour was shown to
those Arminian opinions which ran counter to the common feeling of
the country in favour of Calvinism, that had been strengthened and
advanced by the Synod of Dort. When Charles I came to Edinburgh in the
year 1633, he was attended by Laud; and his design of introducing into
Scotland the external forms of divine service in use in the Anglican
Church was displayed without any disguise. In the royal chapel their
introduction was attended with no difficulty; but elsewhere no one
would hear of it. In Parliament the King met with opposition in his
attempt to determine the most purely external matter of all,—the
dress of the clergy. In proportion as the government favoured the
introduction into Scotland of usages similar to those of the Anglican
Church, zeal for Presbyterianism, which in contrast with these usages
was identified with Puritanism, gained the upper hand. In May 1633 an
address was presented to the King, in which the absence of binding
force in the Articles of Perth was again pointed out, and a restoration
of independent ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and of the old constitution
in general, was demanded. It was urged that a General Assembly of the
clergy ought to be held every year; that the prelates called to a seat
in Parliament were bound by the instructions of the Assembly, and were
responsible to it. What the petitioners desired to restore was the
old independence of the Scottish Church as established on its first
erection, free from all encroachments of the crown, and with a merely
nominal episcopate such as that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span> established by
the statutes of 1592 and 1597, which the King was requested to restore.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of encroachments, which increased notwithstanding
these manifestations of opinion, a peculiar form of opposition grew up
in the Scottish Church, which at any rate went perceptibly beyond the
bounds of passive obedience<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. The ministers hit upon the institution
of private meetings, which were held with the faithful who were in
agreement with them. At the beginning of every quarter notice of these
meetings was secretly given, and every member prepared himself for them
beforehand by fasting. The assembled congregation then set itself to
take into consideration the danger which threatened the true Church
from the action of the bishops. Prayer was made to God that He would
put an end to this danger by wholesome means<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. At times there were
even conflicts in those congregations whose ministers had submitted to
the ordinances of the government. When meetings, instituted after the
model of Geneva, were held before the Communion for putting an end to
all mutual complaints, the ministers were called to account by some
members of the congregation. People would no longer receive the Lord’s
Supper at their hands, nor according to the prescribed ceremonies; but
they sought for men who observed the old ritual, or else they abstained
altogether from communicating. To the official church of the King and
the bishops, almost as in former times, when the revolt from the Papacy
took place, a secret worship was opposed which united men’s hearts in
inward resistance to the attempts of the government.</p>

<p>And on this as well as on the former occasion the opposition spread to
the highest circles in the country.</p>

<p>The Stuart kings of Scotland had striven from the beginning to break
down the importance of the great vassals, which was due to the old clan
relationship, but especially to wrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span> from
them the administration of justice. King James on his last visit had
instituted public discussions about questions of this sort, and with an
air of triumph had announced to the chieftains the joy he felt when he
vindicated his claims on these occasions. But Charles I now assailed
the position which the nobles at that time occupied with regard to
property. The collection of tithes had given the nobles great authority
over the proprietors themselves and over the clergy who were interested
in them, although only to a small extent: these he now made redeemable.
He attempted to take back, either in the interests of the crown or for
the endowment of bishoprics, a part of the property of the Church which
had passed into the possession of the nobles during the tumultuous
times of the Reformation. Even this occasioned great agitation,
especially as it was intended to carry out the measure without giving
compensation. Lord Nithisdale, who attempted to enforce it in the
name of the King, ran a risk of losing his life in consequence. The
violence of feeling was still further increased by the favours granted
in political matters to the Protestant hierarchy<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. Controversies
about precedence arose between the temporal dignitaries of the state
and the bishops, who were reinstated and, arrayed in silk and velvet,
rode to Parliament in the midst of the nobility with all the old
ecclesiastical pomp. At the coronation of 1633 the King wished that
the Archbishop and Primate should take precedence of the Chancellor
for that one day only. The Chancellor Hay, Earl of Kinnoul, answered
that, so long as the King left his office in his hands, he would
retain it with all its privileges, and that no man in a stole should
walk before him. But not rank and honour alone, but very substantial
elements of power, were at stake in this dispute. Among the thirty-two
Lords of Articles, upon whom in Scotland the previous discussion of all
resolutions to be laid before Parliament devolved, the eight bishops
were the chief: they nominated the eight noblemen, and these latter the
sixteen other members. It is plain that by this means they exercised a
very active influence upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1635.</span> deliberations of
Parliament. But the ecclesiastical jurisdiction which was set up was
still more burdensome to the Lords. In Scotland, as well as in England,
a High Commission based upon this supreme jurisdiction of the King was
instituted, in order to bring before the tribunal all transgressions
of ecclesiastical ordinances, and even those persons who were only
suspected of transgressing them. The Privy Council, which exercised
the power of the King in Scotland, was commissioned to enforce its
sentence. The clergy and the men of learning first felt the pressure
of this authority, but neither birth nor rank were a defence against
its proceedings. The Scots affirmed<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> that the tribunal outdid even
the Spanish Inquisition in harshness and cruelty. While in this way
bitter feelings were raised by the collision between the high nobility
and the bishops, the most disagreeable impression of all was made on
the former when King Charles introduced a number of bishops into the
Treasury-board, into the temporal courts of justice, and into the
Privy Council. In old times the seals of the kingdom had been for
the most part in the hands of learned clergymen, because from their
experience in canon as well as in civil law they could best advise the
King: following this practice, Charles I in the year 1635, after the
death of Kinnoul, nominated an ecclesiastic, no other than Archbishop
Spottiswood himself, to the Chancellorship of the kingdom<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. This
dignity had been latterly an object of emulation and ambition among the
temporal lords; and they felt themselves aggrieved when a clergyman,
who thereby combined the supreme spiritual with the supreme temporal
authority, was preferred to them. The person most mortified was
Archibald Lord Lorne, afterwards Marquess of Argyle, a man who thought
that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> a definite claim to the office,
and who indisputably possessed all the capacity required for it. The
aspiring Bishop Maxwell roused the jealousy of the treasurer, Lord
Traquair, who suspected an intention of dispossessing him of his place,
and investing the bishop with it.</p>

<p>In this way the advancement of the ecclesiastical element had already
roused various antipathies of a political and religious nature. The
nobles feared for their possessions and for their jurisdiction,
especially as some well-grounded objections might be made to the
latter; principally however for their share in the authority of the
state, which seemed doomed to pass into the hands of the clergy. The
country clergy cherished anxiety for their independence, and the people
for the accepted ecclesiastical usages with which religion itself
appeared to them to be bound up. Yet all this would hardly have led
to an open outbreak of discontent. Meanwhile, however, the King and
Archbishop Laud again took up an old plan which had been formed by
James I, had been long ready for execution, and had only been postponed
on account of the difficulties into which the King had feared to fall
in consequence,—the plan of fortifying the episcopal power in the
Scottish Church by issuing a new book of canon law, and at the same
time of binding Scotland more closely to England by bringing the Church
service of that country into conformity with the English. A similar
attempt on the part of the Lord Deputy had just succeeded in Ireland:
why should not such a measure be forced through in Scotland? The
majority of the Scottish bishops held out hopes of success.</p>

<p>The Book of Canon Law was first brought out. It was drawn up by three
English bishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishops of
London and Norwich, who belonged to the prevailing school of opinion.
It was sent to Edinburgh, there amended, ratified in this shape by the
King, in May 1635, and promulgated in the year 1636.</p>

<p>It stands in sharply-defined contradiction to the ecclesiastical
customs and to the opinions of the Scots.</p>

<p>The Scottish Church had always opposed the royal supremacy: but in the
new law-book this was laid down and enforced on pain of excommunication
against all who should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1636.</span> resist it, on the ground
that it had been exercised by the Christian emperors of the first age.
The Scots had originally claimed an independent legislative authority
for their Church assemblies: the new law not only ordained that they
must be summoned by the King, but also that even the bishops should not
be authorised to introduce any alteration without the previous consent
of the King. Single ordinances, as for instance those which prescribed
the form of prayer in the Church, or the consequences of divorce,
ran directly counter to Scottish usage. But the authority of the
bishops, which all the measures aimed at securing, gave the greatest
offence. The bishops alone were to have the right of expounding the
Scriptures; private meetings of ministers for this purpose were to
be forbidden; no one was to be allowed to controvert the opinion of
another minister of the same diocese from the pulpit without permission
of the bishop; without this permission no one was to give instruction
either in public or in private; the bishops were to inflict punishment
at their discretion when any publication appeared in print without the
approval of the censor<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. It is plain that these provisions put the
whole internal life of the Church in regard to opinion and doctrine
into the hands of the bishops. And was not the constitution of the
Scottish Church virtually abolished when canons which made so thorough
a change were to be introduced without the participation of the General
Assembly? This was an affront to the national feeling of the Scots.
‘Supposing it were true,’ they said, ‘that the Scottish Kirk belonged
to the province of York (as was formerly pretended), yet more than the
bare warrant of the King would be required to introduce ordinances
which affected the life of the Church collectively.’ The laws enforced
beforehand, and that under threat of the severest penalties, the
acceptance of a liturgy which had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>In October 1636 this liturgy was proclaimed by the King, and the order
to conform to it was promulgated amid the sound of trumpets. No one
had yet seen it. But a rumour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> circulated to
the effect that to the English ritual, which already retained too much
of Roman Catholicism, it added still further ceremonies of a decidedly
Popish tendency. It was to be introduced at Easter 1637: at last it
made its appearance, at any rate in single copies.</p>

<p>The introduction into the Scottish Church of the English Prayer-book in
its entirety had been originally contemplated, and in no other way can
the arguments be explained which are given in the preface. The union
of Christian churches in one system of doctrine and under one ritual
was therein stated to be the most desirable end possible, which, as
the authors lamented, could not be universally attained, but must be
striven for in those countries which obeyed the same sovereign. The
Scottish bishops, however, had thought that the book would meet with a
better reception in their country, if it were not simply the English
Prayer-book. Draughts of alterations were more than once forwarded
from England to Scotland, and sent back again from the latter country:
the King himself had a personal share in them. For the most part they
were attempts to return to ancient rituals that had existed before
those ages which could properly be called hierarchical. If the choice
lay between Protestant forms of expression, the older were accordingly
preferred to the more recent. The greatest stir was made by the formula
which was prescribed for the administration of the Lord’s Supper. The
selection of this was connected with the differences between the first
Book of Common Prayer of the year 1549, and the second of 1552, which
was drawn up at a time when Swiss doctrinal conceptions exercised
a stronger influence. The first form clings to the doctrine of the
Real Presence: the second corresponds more nearly to the idea of a
commemorative meal. Under Queen Elizabeth, who believed in the Real
Presence, both formulae had been combined; in the Scottish Liturgy Laud
returned to the first. Nothing is there said about Transubstantiation:
the formula could not be called Catholic but Lutheran. But it was at
any rate a departure from Calvinistic conceptions, which regarded
Lutheran views as far too nearly allied to Roman Catholic: popular
comprehension interchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> the one with the
other. But nothing more was wanting to give prevalence to the opinion,
for which the way had already been sufficiently prepared, that the
Liturgy was to pave the way for the re-introduction of Catholicism.</p>

<p>Neither Charles I nor Archbishop Laud had any such design. But could
any one be surprised that they were charged with entertaining it? The
toleration which the King allowed the Catholics to enjoy, and from
which the Catholic element received fresh life in the neighbouring
kingdom of Ireland; his connexion with the Catholic powers; his
dilatoriness in the affair of the Palatinate; his inclination to Spain,
which was constantly re-appearing; the presence of a Papal envoy at
the English court; the authority which men professing Catholicism
acquired in the administration of the State,—all these considerations
might well supply reasons why this anxiety might be felt without any
discredit to those who entertained it; though rumour exaggerated their
importance. Further indications were supplied by the book of Canon Law,
which gave to the power of the bishops an extension corresponding with
Catholic rather than with Protestant ideas; and even if fears were
not exactly entertained about the further existence of Protestantism,
yet the introduction of Anglican forms into Scotland could not fail
to create general excitement. Tidings had just come of the shocking
punishments which were inflicted in England upon the opponents of
hierarchical tendencies: were men to be exposed to a similar procedure
in Scotland? An instance had already been furnished of the lengths
to which ecclesiastical tendencies could lead when supported by the
laws against high treason, so extraordinarily severe in Scotland. Lord
Balmerino had been condemned to death for the share which he had taken
in drawing up, or even in merely spreading about, the Puritan address
before referred to: he owed his life solely to the mercy of the King.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Canons and of the Liturgy was not due to
fondness for ceremonies nor to a passing fancy, but it was the keystone
of the system which James I had all his life kept in view without
carrying it out. Charles I took steps to bring it into execution. The
Liturgy would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> not have had much importance
without the Canons: with the latter it completed the edifice of
political and ecclesiastical subordination, which for the first time
reduced Scotland to complete subjection. Properly speaking the whole
country was against it: it was opposed by the Presbyterian element,
nowhere stronger than there, by the native government itself, and by
the great nobles, who felt themselves specially threatened and alarmed
by the precedent established.</p>

<p>Not precisely on Easter Day, but soon afterwards, the introduction of
the Liturgy was begun. It did not appear in print till April, when the
arrangement by which every parish was to be supplied with two copies,
could be carried out. Here and there divine worship after the new form
was introduced, for instance in Galloway. Opposition indeed showed
itself even during service, but it was treated as a disturbance of
outward order, and had no further effect.</p>

<p>As people delayed to purchase copies the Privy Council renewed its
ordinances, threatening the refractory with the pains of rebellion.
On this the bishops thought that they could no longer delay in the
capital, although the murmurs were loudest there. They appointed the
last Sunday before the end of the regular session of the courts of
justice for introducing the new Liturgy, in the hope that people on
their return home would spread over the whole land the tidings of its
introduction in the capital, and that this example would be followed.
They perceived a sullen movement under their feet which they hoped to
put an end to by prompt and consistent action.</p>

<p>But the adversaries of the Liturgy would not allow matters to go
so far. The execution of the measure in the capital must have been
followed by so great an effect, that they deemed it necessary to resist
it.</p>

<p>Immediately before the day appointed, a number of proud nobles and
ministers zealous for the faith were seen assembling in Edinburgh.
Tradition affirms, although as often happens the statement is not fully
attested, that the opposition which was then offered was excited and
prepared by them.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of July, 1637, the dignitaries of Church and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1637.</span> State had assembled in the great church of St. Giles in
Edinburgh. The Chancellor-Archbishop, many bishops, among whom the
Bishop of Edinburgh did not fail to appear, the members of the Privy
Council, although these were not all there, the members of the High
Court of Justice, and the magistrates of the town, were there; they
wished by their presence to give authority to this solemn proceeding.
But the Dean had hardly opened the book when fierce cries arose from
the midst of the assembled audience, which were redoubled when, at
a signal from the Bishop, he began to read. Abusive epithets were
directed against both, giving utterance to the opinion that they were
lending themselves to an anti-Christian proceeding, for the sake
of their own personal advantage; that the book was papistical, nay
Satanic, and that Satan was already introduced into God’s house. The
women of the lower class who were present showed that rough impetuosity
which characterises them in their personal behaviour: they rose up and
threw their stools at the heads of the Bishop and the Dean. It was
necessary to remove the tumultuous crowd before the Liturgy could be
read or the sermon preached: even then this was done only amid noises
at the doors and showers of stones discharged against the windows. The
Bishop was attacked on his way home, and was saved only by the escort
and protection of a temporal lord<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. And so lively and powerful was
the excitement, that the lawless and seditious proceedings which had
taken place could not be punished.</p>

<p>On the 28th of July the Provost and Baillies of the town promised
to provide for the peaceful introduction of the Liturgy on the next
Sunday, and for the security of the persons concerned in it. The Privy
Council wished for an assurance on the part of the citizens, over whom
the magistrates had not complete power. The arrangements made for this
purpose were thereupon to be proclaimed with beat of drum, but the
repugnance to the measure exhibited itself so strongly that no one
ventured to stir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> it up to fresh outbreaks. On
Saturday, July 29, the Archbishop and Bishops saw reason to propose
that the use of the new Book of Common Prayer in Edinburgh should be
postponed until the King should make known his pleasure in respect of
the punishment of the tumult which had occurred, and should have taken
measures for its peaceful execution. Meanwhile neither the old nor the
new Liturgy was to be enforced, but only the sermon was to be delivered
by obedient and compliant ministers<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. The Privy Council assented to
this.</p>

<p>The civic authorities took a fatal step when they gave way to an
outbreak of the seditious feeling of the capital, and claimed the
immediate interference of the distant sovereign in its behalf. In order
to explain the commotion, people compared the noisy crowd with Balaam’s
ass, which was obliged to speak because men held silence: an expression
in the Biblical phraseology of the time, which however may intimate the
silent agreement of the upper ranks with the masses. They had been told
that the Liturgy would destroy the old faith and bring back Popery.
But what is more popular among great Protestant peoples than hatred of
Popery? The ministers had from the first aimed at teaching the people
that in matters of religion no blind obedience was due to the ruling
powers, but that God must be obeyed rather than men. And with this
doctrine on the present occasion an uprising of the multitude in the
town against the magistrates was immediately connected, like those
which had accompanied religious excitement on countless occasions,
especially in the sixteenth century. The magistrates would have been
glad to conform; but the populace held out and carried the day.</p>

<p>The public peace in the kingdom of Great Britain rested upon the
undisturbed observance of the ordinances introduced, and on the
customary obedience paid to constituted authority: the monarchy as we
have seen was without weapons. But if order was to prevail anywhere, it
must be disturbed nowhere. If a breach occurred in any one place, as at
this time in Edinburgh, it affected the whole country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1637.</span> The capital of the second of the two kingdoms had, by throwing
aside its spiritual, at the same time thrown aside its temporal
obedience.</p>

<p>After this first step in resistance, a second and more definite one
was immediately taken. Some zealous ministers in Fife met the repeated
summons to introduce the book by a demand that they might be allowed
to prove it first, especially as it had not been laid before the
General Assembly, which was the representative body of the Church.
The Bishop of Ross replied to them that they were mistaken; that the
representation of the Church was in the hands of the bishops. But this
question was the great question of the day. The ministers, who insisted
upon their old established claims, presented a petition to the Privy
Council which, amid all this commotion, thought it expedient to hold a
session on August 23, in the middle of the vacation. In this petition
they based their request for a suspension of the order issued to them
simply on the ground that the Liturgy had not been confirmed either
by the General Assembly, which since the Reformation had always, they
said, had the management of Church affairs, or by Parliament<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. ‘This
Church,’ they exclaimed, ‘is a free and independent Church, just as the
kingdom is a free and independent kingdom.’ They thought that as the
patriots should decide what was best for the kingdom, in the same way
the pastors should decide what was best for the Church. They held that
the Romish Church, to which this book brought them nearer, was just
as idolatrous, superstitious, and anti-Christian now as at the moment
when they had separated from it. The expressions which the speakers
used were echoed back from all parts of the country. The Privy Council
remarked with astonishment, that even those who had hitherto obeyed the
will and the laws of the King, made common cause with his opponents.
The Council thought that it was justified in suspending all further
steps for introducing the Liturgy until the King had again taken the
matter into consideration, and had expressed his will decisively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span>

<p>And in truth there could never perhaps have been a more opportune
moment for seriously weighing the position of affairs, for
investigating the causes of the discontent, and for meditating how to
remove them. If any one had called to mind by what means James I had
once succeeded in quelling the rebellion of the town of Edinburgh,
he would have found that his success had been principally due to the
King’s agreement with the nobles of the country. If it had been asked
how he had achieved so much in ecclesiastical matters, it would have
been seen that the scale was turned in his favour, because among
churchmen too he always had a party on his side, and knew how to avoid
steps which would excite prejudices universally felt. But on the
present occasion there were found, even among the bishops, some who
resisted the introduction of the Liturgy, so that the Archbishop of
Canterbury himself expressed a wish to learn the objections which were
made against certain articles, and showed an inclination to pay heed
to them. But it is quite clear that the matter could now no longer
be settled in this way. Men’s minds had been seized by anxiety lest
their old native Church with which the independence and freedom of the
country were bound up, should be brought to an end. This fear could no
longer be dispelled by the surrender of one or two controverted points
of theology. The King, dissatisfied with the Privy Council, which had
not, as he thought, done all that lay in its power to enforce the two
books, and extremely incensed by the tumult in the Scottish capital,
demanded the punishment of the disorder, and the performance of divine
worship according to the prescribed form<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. He did nothing to calm
either the nobles or the clergy; his declaration was not calculated
to meet the existing state of affairs, of which the disturbances were
symptoms, but rather the symptoms themselves, which he regarded as
manifestations of a disobedience which the weight of his authority
would soon suppress. But while he entertained this hope, he was forced
to learn by experience that the cause of resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1637.</span> and disobedience received almost universal support in Scotland.</p>

<p>Expectations were rife that an answer from the King would shortly be
communicated to the people; but at the same time fears were entertained
lest an attempt should be made to introduce the Liturgy in Edinburgh
by force on the arrival of the Earl of Lennox, who was on his way from
his ancestral castle to the English court. At this juncture some of the
more eminent among the great nobles, such as the Earls of Sutherland,
Rothes, and Dalhousie, a great portion of the gentry, especially from
the neighbouring counties, such as Fife, where hardly any remained at
home, some deputies from the boroughs, and about a hundred ministers,
assembled in Edinburgh in order to prevent the enforcement of any
obnoxious measures, and to defend the ministers informed against by
giving them free support in the Scottish fashion. When the reasons
urged by these ministers had been stated, the assembled body declared
that the introduction of the Liturgy would disturb the peace of men’s
consciences and the harmony of the country. They called upon the
Privy Council to represent to the King the importance of the matter,
which they said he ought not to regard as an ordinary tumult, and to
prevail upon him not to tamper with the religion they professed. The
Privy Council accepted the petition, which had the assent of its lay
members; Lord Traquair had himself looked through the petition, and had
softened some harsh expressions in it. The Earl of Lennox promised to
do everything at court to put the King into a frame of mind favourable
to it.</p>

<p>Thus the King’s designs were met by a demonstration on the part of
the most distinguished Scots, and indeed of almost the whole country
itself; and it is clear into what embarrassment he must have been
thrown by it, between the desire to give effect to his will, and
the wish to continue at peace with the land of his birth. But from
the first moment the opposition between them was too strong to be
controlled by such considerations as these.</p>

<p>The cause of Presbyterianism in Scotland was also the cause of the
Presbyterians in Ireland and England. We hear of violent pamphlets
which arrived from England and poured oil upon the flame. The greatest
activity was displayed by the ministers who had been banished from
the Scottish colonies in Ireland. Unable to offer further resistance
in that country to the ordinances of Wentworth and of the Irish
bishops, they sought refuge in Scotland: and as they found there a
spirit like their own ready to meet them, they threw themselves with
ardent and unbounded zeal into opposition to the progress of that
episcopal authority which had compelled them to retire from Ireland.
That discipline and subordination which had hitherto been maintained
in Scotland had been broken up by the course of affairs above
mentioned. All obstacles had thus been removed from their path in that
country: the injustice which they had suffered doubled their hatred
of the system of Charles I and his ministers; and they exercised an
incalculable influence upon the excitement of Puritan and Calvinist
feelings prevailing in Scotland<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p>But the cause of the Scots appeared to be at the same time the cause
of Protestantism in general, which had been everywhere placed at a
disadvantage in consequence of the defeat of Nordlingen. In the year
1637 the arms of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> Catholics asserted their
supremacy on the Rhine and in the Netherlands. The Swedes were driven
back to the coast of the Baltic, and were not disinclined to accept a
pecuniary indemnity. The Peace of Prague, which united the interests
of the Emperor and of Spain with those of certain powerful princes of
the empire, but did not satisfy the just demands of the Protestants,
appeared destined to become an inviolable law of the empire. By this
superiority of the Austro-Spanish power, France, which the year before
was obliged to withstand a most dangerous invasion from the side of
the Netherlands, felt herself threatened. We shall return hereafter to
the political complication in the midst of which France and the other
powers defended themselves against this ascendancy. They believed that
by so doing they were at the same time defending Protestantism. It
would have seemed very damaging to that cause if King Charles, to whom
all the world ascribed an inclination in favour of Spain, had succeeded
in carrying out his designs in Scotland. But, even apart from this, the
advance which Catholicism was once more beginning to make roused the
Protestant spirit to the utmost vigilance. From the Protestant point
of view, the re-establishment in a Protestant country of institutions
resembling the old form of worship and the old constitution appeared
exceedingly dangerous. This is the true reason why people detected a
tendency towards Catholicism in the introduction of the Liturgy. It was
not found in the words, but the general tone which was felt to pervade
it led men to this interpretation. The Scottish troops which served
under the Swedish flag, their connexion with their native country, and
their movements backward and forward, were the means through which
the common feeling for Protestantism at large was kept alive in their
country. If the fear lest the great religious struggle should have an
unsuccessful issue was in the minds of so many Englishmen one of the
principal motives for emigrating to America, how could the same cause
fail to act upon the Scots as well? They thought that, supported by
their ancient rights and laws, they could offer resistance without
incurring on this account the guilt of rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span>

<p>The 17th of October was the critical day for the course which they
afterwards adopted.</p>

<p>The harvest had now been gathered in, and a still larger number of
persons than before had assembled in Edinburgh, with the intention of
moving the capital, where the magistrates still adhered to the side
of the King, to join in the petition which had been presented; and at
the same time they wished to await there the answer of the King. A
courier had already brought one, which was made known on the evening
of that same day. It had not exactly the character of a refusal, but
rather that of a postponement<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. The King declared that he could not
yet give instructions on account of the disturbances which had not yet
been suppressed. For this reason he suspended the competence of the
Privy Council in church matters as the first step, and caused orders
to be given that all who had come to the town should leave it within
twenty-four hours. In order to remove the Privy Council from contact
with the excited multitude, he ordered its sittings to be transferred
from the capital to Linlithgow. In this manner he thought to check
the influence of popular excitement upon legislation and government.
But it would be impossible to describe what a storm broke out at this
announcement among the assembled people. They saw in it the intention
and will of the King to carry out the introduction of the Liturgy, at
any rate as soon as he should find an opportunity, in spite of the
wishes of his people to the contrary. One of the ministers present,
himself a Presbyterian and an opponent of the Liturgy, expresses
his astonishment nevertheless at the violent agitation by which his
countrymen were seized: he says that it could not have been greater
if any one had wished to force upon them the Mass-book itself<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. In
this frame of mind they were not satisfied with repeating and enlarging
the petition, but a project began to gain ground which gave its whole
tone to the movement in Scotland. Not content with standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1637.</span> on the defensive against the Liturgy and the Book of Canon
Law, the assembled people resolved to go further and to attack those to
whom, in their opinion, the attempt to introduce them must be ascribed,
on the ground that the measure was contrary to law. They resolved to
make a formal charge against the bishops. For they thought that the
bishops were the original promoters of both these books by which the
doctrine and constitution of the Church established by law was to be
upset; that it was intended to bring back the country to superstition
and idolatry; that the King issued these commands at their instigation;
and that the people were thrown into the unfortunate dilemma of being
obliged either to suffer prosecutions and excommunication, or else to
break their covenant with God; that every one, in fact, must endure
either the vengeance of God or the wrath of the King. The nobility, the
gentry, and the clergy, held separate meetings: each order had its own
subjects for deliberation. However much the clergy might be divided
into different schools, comprising adherents of Melville, of Gladstane,
and even of Spottiswood, who sought to adjust their differences, they
all agreed in opposing the present innovations. The complaint was first
proposed and resolved upon among the clergy, then among the gentry,
then among the nobility. Before the close of the evening a commission
from the three orders was appointed to draw it up, and executed a
draught of it without delay<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. In this the reasons assigned were
first set out. It was therein said that the petitioners, as in duty
bound, addressed their complaints against the prelates and bishops, to
God, the King, and the country, and prayed to be heard against them
before a legal tribunal. Next morning this document was signed by
twenty-four lords and three hundred gentlemen, and in the afternoon by
all the ministers present. To many the expressions seemed too harsh;
others thought the whole proceeding too violent: but it was the only
step from which they promised themselves any result. A skilful lawyer,
Archibald Johnstone, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> advocate, who combined
zeal for the cause with a capacity for finding amid the flames of legal
controversy forms which could be justified, had principally influenced
the assembly at this moment, and had led them to think of a petition.
They were wise in taking his advice, for what they required was not
a manifestation of feeling, but the certainty of firm ground in the
further conflicts that were to be expected. People felt that they would
be brought to account for what had happened, and that the petition
submitted to the King would be an object of judicial proceedings. The
complaint against the bishops was first of all intended to put them
in the position of parties concerned, and to prevent them from being
able any longer to sit or to give judgment in the court of justice from
which a sentence of condemnation might emanate. But this complaint
had also a more comprehensive scope. Its authors did not intend to
oppose the King as such, but to oppose the combination of temporal and
spiritual authority, which constituted the essence of the form of state
government he intended to set up. While the leaders of the movement
recurred to the old laws, and considered the anti-hierarchical usage
of the country as the foundation of all legality, and as that which
above all must be represented in independent courts, an opportunity was
gained for attacking the existence of episcopal power, whether in its
present extension or under any form at all. From the existing order
they went back to the circumstances of the time when Presbyterianism
was in its vigour as the only legal state of things.</p>

<p>But if everything now depended on maintaining the legal ground, no
inconsiderable obstacle appeared to arise from the inability of the
Privy Council to adopt the new petition and complaint;—for this
reason if for no other, that according to the last mandate of the
King its commission in ecclesiastical affairs had been withdrawn.
Manifestly therefore it could not take any legal action. Nothing else
could be expected than that the spiritual courts, especially the High
Commission, should begin proceedings against the petitioners.</p>

<p>The danger was increased by the fact that Edinburgh was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1637.</span> not only still liable to punishment for the old offence,
but that it exposed itself to still heavier penalties by fresh tumults.
While the three orders were pursuing their deliberations there, a
rush was made in the town upon the council-house. The magistrates
were actually compelled to pass their word that another petition in
accordance with the prevailing temper should be sent up on the part of
the town, deprecating alterations in the Church<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. The nobles exerted
their influence in this tumult in order to check acts of extreme
violence, to which the people themselves appeared greatly disposed. But
at all events, public order had been disturbed afresh by this means;
and people felt that they must make up their minds that the government
would do everything to chastise this fresh act of insubordination.</p>

<p>In order to meet this twofold danger, the assembled nobles and
others, to whom on their request permission had been given to remain
four-and-twenty hours longer in the capital, adopted a second
resolution, which like the first entailed very wide consequences.
This took place at a supper of the nobility, at which deputies from
the clergy and the gentry also appeared. They agreed in refusing to
acknowledge the jurisdiction of the High Commission, in case it should
summon such as then signed or should afterwards sign the petitions
against the two books, and to support one another in common in this
refusal. By this means they not only secured themselves, but also the
citizens of Edinburgh, who joined in supporting the petition, and who
were expressly allowed to do so.</p>

<p>These were the events of October 17 and 18, 1637. If we consider
merely the tumults in Scotland, they appear, as in so many other
cases, to be the chance result of momentary ebullitions; but if we
look at the legal steps which were coupled with them, we perceive
connexion and consistency in the leading ideas. The Scots had now won
a position, which they secured by mutually engaging to resist all
steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> which the government was expected to take
immediately, and which might be detrimental to those who had shared in
the resistance. At the same time, by means of the petition, the way
was paved for a return to the old condition of the country, which had
preceded the establishment of episcopacy; and the widest prospect was
opened in consequence. The petitioners already came forward as a great
association embracing the whole country.</p>

<p>In a new assembly which was held in the middle of November, but which
was appointed at the earlier date just mentioned, an additional step
was taken which imparted a certain organisation to this association.</p>

<p>This assembly had a different character from the preceding. All tumult
was carefully avoided: those who were present were hardly noticed
in the street. Conferences about the petition and the acceptance
of the complaint were held with Traquair, who had come with two of
his colleagues from Linlithgow to the town for this object; but the
importance of the day was derived from another feature.</p>

<p>Those who were assembled set up a claim to be allowed to leave behind
in Edinburgh representatives invested with full powers, assigning
the very plausible reason that this would conduce to the general
tranquillity, as they would then not be obliged to return frequently
and in great numbers. It did not escape the Privy Council how obnoxious
these representatives in their turn might also become: but another
learned lawyer, none other than Thomas Hope, the King’s Advocate,
declared himself in favour of the scheme. It is affirmed that he had
been in the secret of the whole movement, and had directed the steps
taken from the beginning, and especially those of the nobility. He
gave it as his judgment that it was lawful to choose representatives
not only for Parliament, and extraordinary assemblies of the Estates,
but also for every other public matter. On this the Privy Council
could offer no opposition. It was determined that two members of the
gentry from each county, a minister from every presbytery, and a deputy
from every borough, with as many nobles as might choose to come,
should constitute the representative body, but that besides these a
smaller committee also, presided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> over by some
nobleman, should sit in Edinburgh, and have the immediate management of
affairs<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>

<p>And into this great league the town of Edinburgh also was now admitted.
For it was said that what the common people there had been guilty of in
the days of the excitement amounted to nothing more than such outcry
and resistance as suppliants might oppose to the intended alteration in
religion. The committee was charged to be on the watch lest anything
should be done to injure them, and to take care that no attempt was
made to introduce the Liturgy into the town by a surprise.</p>

<p>Thus the party which took the name of petitioners, came forward united
in an organisation embracing the whole country. From the general body
went forth the elected representatives, and from these the committee,
in which the most enterprising magnates and the most zealous ministers
were united. They formed a league to repel every movement on the part
of the authority of the State, which might be made towards carrying out
the King’s policy. The most experienced lawyers, among whom was the
King’s Advocate himself, were on their side.</p>

<p>Matters had gone thus far, when in the beginning of December the Earl
of Roxburgh entered Scotland with a reply from the King. Properly
speaking it did not contain a formal answer to the earlier petition.
The delay was excused on the score of the disturbances in the capital,
by which the honour of the King was declared to have been insulted:
but, while Charles I reserved to himself the right of punishing these
offences, he sought to quiet men’s feelings in the matter of religion.
He declared in express terms that he loathed the superstition of the
Papacy from his very soul, and that he would never do anything which
ran counter to the religious confession or the laws of his kingdom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> Scotland. The Privy Council did not delay for
a moment to have this declaration everywhere proclaimed to the sound
of trumpets, and as it produced a very soothing impression, it led
them to hope that they might effect an adjustment of affairs on this
basis. They said that the King manifestly gave up the introduction of
the Liturgy: what more, they asked, could be expected from so kind
and gentle a sovereign? Traquair said that a symptom of submission
on the part of the capital, a single prostration on the part of its
representatives, the deliverance of their charter into the King’s
hands, would content the King, for that he was most interested in
preventing foreigners from believing that his authority was despised by
his own people.</p>

<p>But the united petitioners were not to be satisfied so easily. They
wished to be assured of the withdrawal of the Liturgy not by equivocal
expressions, but in distinct and final terms. Above all, moreover,
they wished to uphold the view that theirs was the truly legal mode
of proceeding. They had taken counsel afresh with the most eminent
advocates—the names of five of them are given—how the movements that
had been begun, on the part of the town as well as on their own, might
be justified by their aim, which was the restoration of the laws;
and how on the other hand, the illegality of the spiritual tribunals
might be proved. They showed signs of an intention to institute
legal proceedings against those who calumniously asserted that their
behaviour had been seditious. They upheld the complaint against the
bishops with unabated zeal. Traquair had already at the meeting in
November held out to them a prospect of reaching their end, if they
would take their stand on the rejection of the two books alone. They
answered that so much damage had been done to the constitution of
Church and State, and to the freedom of the subject in regard to person
and property by the bishops and the High Commission, that they could
not be tolerated: that if the Privy Council would not receive the
complaints against them, it might at least allow an information to be
laid before it in regard to these questions. The Privy Council at any
rate did entirely reject this proposal: it declared itself disposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> to receive both petition and information, in
case the King’s answer, when it came, should fail to satisfy the
petitioners. But this had now actually happened. The confederate
Scots demanded with impetuosity the acceptance of the petition and
complaint. The Privy Council long refused to accede to the demand;
it required that at least some violent and offensive expressions
should be moderated; but as these affected the gist of the matter, the
petitioners remained immovable. On their threat that if their demands
were refused they would betake themselves immediately to the King with
their petition, the magistrates, who did not wish to be passed over,
resolved to receive the petition as it stood (December 21, 1637<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>).
Lord Loudon, after the fashion which prevailed in the courts in
Scotland, appended to it (in the name of all) a ‘declinatory,’ that is,
a repudiation of every judicial sentence, which the bishops might take
part in drawing up, on the ground that they were the accused, and that
they would, if they sat, be judges of their own cause.</p>

<p>Thus what was clearly in itself a struggle against the will and
intention of the King acquired the appearance of a legal controversy
with the holders of episcopal power: the resistance in both cases was
based on the same principle. For both attacks aimed at setting up again
the old Kirk, so bound up with the independence of the country, as the
only legitimate Church.</p>

<p>But all was not yet complete till the King had accepted the complaint
against the bishops. Traquair set out for the court with the petition
in which the complaint was embodied, with the declinatory of the
petitioners and all other documents. He hoped, by giving thorough
information about the state of affairs in Scotland, to induce the King
to grant yet further indulgence beyond that of which Roxburgh had held
out hopes.</p>

<p>King Charles did not really require new information about the
particulars of what had occurred in Scotland; he was only too well
informed of each and every circumstance by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span>
adherents, especially by the bishops. The petitions and complaints
had been given him to read before they had yet been addressed to
him: he knew who had drawn them up, what exceptions had been taken
to them, how they had at last been adopted: he knew the behaviour of
each individual, and liked or disliked him accordingly. Traquair set
before him, most of all, the power of the opposition, which he thought
it was no longer possible to break down; he said that the King would
require an army to procure acceptance for the book of the Liturgy: that
in Scotland, now at all events, people would not allow the national
Church to be governed by any one in England: that they would not submit
to the influence of the Archbishop of Canterbury: that they demanded
a parliament in order to bring controversial questions to a decision
in the country itself; and that people would give way to such a body
alone<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. At least he himself affirmed that he had expressed these
views. But Traquair was not a man whose statements could be accepted
without reserve. He was himself one of the opponents of the bishops:
he, as little as the other Scottish statesmen, wished to see them
politically powerful: but at the same time, while he was aiming at
acquiring importance in the estimation of the people, in order to
increase his importance in the eyes of the sovereign, he fell into
an equivocal position: no one trusted his assurances entirely. Other
representations had also been made, according to which nothing but
resolution and quiet perseverance were needed to revive the wonted
obedience of the people. What a demand, it was said, was made when the
King was asked to receive a complaint against the bishops who had been
leagued with him in the same enterprise! He would by compliance have
declared his own conduct illegal, and have broken up the constitution,
which had been founded in Scotland at the cost of so much trouble by
himself and his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span>

<p>The decision which he gave was the opposite of that which had been
expected from him. In order once for all to avert the blow which
threatened the bishops, Charles I took upon himself the responsibility
of everything which had been laid to their charge. He met the
suspicions which had been thrown upon the Liturgy by the assertion
that it was only intended to serve as a means of strengthening true
religion and of dispelling superstition: he took praise to himself for
the trouble which he had personally taken in its composition: he said
that there was no word in it which he had not approved: he continued
firm in his resolve that it must and should be accepted. He still
adhered to his point of view on church matters with a full sense of his
dignity. He said that if meetings had been held and petitions forwarded
to him in opposition to the book, he would ascribe this conduct rather
to mistaken zeal than to intentional disobedience, and that he would
pardon it; but that for the future he forbade every assembly of this
kind under threat of the penalties inflicted on treason.</p>

<p>James I had always succeeded in keeping alive the idea of the obedience
that was due to him. Following his example, Charles I came forward
personally, as it were, in defence of his cause: was it not likely,
he thought, that the disturbance would be kept within bounds on this
occasion also by the interposition of the supreme authority? Would men
refuse to seize the means of escape afforded by the amnesty which the
King offered, and prefer to break with him instead?</p>

<p>But already during the last tumult astonishment had been excited by
the slight effect which the name of the King had produced. We read in
a contemporary letter that any one wishing to take King Charles’s part
would have endangered his life, that a demoniacal frenzy possessed the
people, that men had now a notion that Popery was at their doors, and
would not let it go. Baillie expresses his fear lest they should be
forced to drink the dregs of God’s cup which had been so bitter for the
French and Dutch, and his apprehension not merely of a schism in the
Church, but of a civil war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span>

<p>The King had been supposed, from his previous declaration, to
disapprove of the innovations attempted; for he had then said that he
would maintain the laws, to which these innovations were plainly seen
to be opposed: if nevertheless he now approved them, this change was
also regarded as the work of the bishops only, by whom the name of the
King was thought to be abused. But people could never bow to this, and
allow the bishops in any way to resume those powers of which they were
thought to have been virtually deprived. As the royal proclamation
declared all previous assemblies and their resolutions, supplications,
and petitions to be null and void, it was thought necessary, before it
was received throughout Scotland, to forestal it by a protestation, and
in this way to keep the declinatory in force. Measures were taken with
this object at the Castle of Stirling, in Linlithgow, and above all in
Edinburgh, where the main body of petitioners now again appeared. In
order to keep them together, and to enable those who resisted the royal
proclamation to take up an imposing position, a still more universal
demonstration seemed requisite. More than half a century before, when
the Western world was most violently shaken by the conflict between
Catholicism and Protestantism, and the Scots feared that they had
secret adherents of Catholicism present among them, they had set up
a confession of faith in which all leanings in that direction were
abjured in harsh terms (March, 1581). This confession, which King James
had approved, had been considered as a covenant of the nation with
its own members and with God, for it was sworn to in the high name of
God. A design was now embraced not only of renewing it, which had been
done more than once, but of giving it a fresh and immediate importance
by adapting it to the prevailing tone of affairs. Alexander Henderson
and Archibald Johnston the lawyer, who were the leaders and pioneers
of every step of the movement, were commissioned to draw out the
alterations, which they then laid in the first instance before Lords
Rothes, Loudon and Balmerino. It was not altogether an easy matter to
find a formula with which not only those who had previously conformed
would be contented, but those also who from the beginning had placed
themselves in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> opposition: at last however
one was arrived at. The gist of the declaration drawn up lies in the
identification of the King’s efforts to reduce them to Anglicanism
with the hostile movements of the Catholics in former times. It was
laid down that the religious abuses noticed in the last petitions and
declarations might be looked upon in the same light as if they had
been condemned in the old confession: every one pledged himself to
withstand them with all his might as long as he lived, and in so doing
to defend each man his neighbour against every one: whatever was done
to the meanest among them on this account was to be considered as
affecting each and all of them in their own persons. On February 28,
1638, this agreement—of all which bear the name of Covenant the most
famous—was read in the church of the Black Friars at Edinburgh from
the original parchment on which the clerk had written it, and after the
scruples which some few ventured to express had been easily set aside,
was at once signed. The first who then and there appended his name
was the Earl of Sutherland: a whole series of the most distinguished
names in the country followed his: then the members for the counties
and the gentry signed, and the day after, the citizens and the clergy.
The document was spread out on a tombstone in the churchyard. Many
are said to have opened a vein in order to sign it with their blood;
others added to their names words which gave additional force to their
signature. With the religious enthusiasm of those who signed—for in
fact people thought that they were opposing an insuperable barrier
to Popery, and were establishing for ever the prevailing faith—the
feeling found vent that only in this way could they secure themselves
against the hostility of the bishops and the strong arm of the King.
But this was more important for the inhabitants of Edinburgh than for
any one else. The original document was carried through the streets of
the town attended by women and children who cheered and wept at the
same time.</p>

<p>Every one still avoided mentioning the King’s name with any feeling
of hostility in these proceedings: they asserted on the contrary,
that they were contending for God and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> the
King. But who could have failed to perceive that the current of the
agitation would be turned against the King himself, in proportion as
he declared that the cause of the bishops was identical with his own?
He had once more solemnly proclaimed the old policy of an alliance
between hierarchical principles and the monarchy. But the Scottish
petitioners, in a meeting which he declared to be treasonable, set
before him demands which aimed at dividing the sceptre and the mitre
for ever. They explicitly stated that the recal of both books would not
content them: they demanded the withdrawal of the High Commission, the
origin of which they said was illegal, on the ground that powers such
as it possessed could only be conferred by the General Assembly and by
Parliament. They demanded, not exactly the abrogation of the Articles
of Perth, for they had been adopted in Parliament, but the abolition
of the penalties annexed to their infringement, for which no such
authority was found. They did not in so many terms desire the removal
of bishops, but asked for the restoration of the restrictions under
which they had formerly been appointed: they adhered to their demand
that the bishops should be called to account for their transgression
of the laws of the land, and that before the Presbyterian General
Assembly, by virtue of the statute of 1610: they wished that this
should be summoned yearly for the future: that the Church should be
secured by statute of Parliament, so that no alteration affecting
it should ever be introduced unless the General Assembly had been
previously informed of it<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p>It was Henderson and Johnston who put these demands into shape, as well
as the preceding: they were laid before the King almost as conditions
of peace from which no abatement could be made.</p>

<p>Charles I was surprised, affected, and deeply mortified. What he
had undertaken was nothing new, nor strictly speaking arbitrary. He
felt himself free from any real inclination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span>
towards Catholicism. All that he had set his heart on was the close
union of Scotland with England, the removal of oppressive aristocratic
privileges, and the strengthening and confirmation of the monarchy.
His ordinances were but a fresh step along the path on which his
father had entered. But downright crying acts of violence are not
needed to call forth violent and general storms. What stirred men’s
feelings and provoked opposition on this occasion was the stronger
pressure which the King thought himself entitled to use, but which
the people and the great nobles feared would effect the completion
of a detested system. Taking their stand on the ancient laws of the
country, which they expounded in a popular and Presbyterian sense,
the Scots set themselves with logical consistency to curtail the
importance of the monarch. From defensive they passed to offensive
measures. King Charles thought it almost mockery in them to set the
new Covenant on a level with the old<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>: for although in both the
duty of mutual defence had been set forth, yet in the old steps were
to be taken under the lead of the King; in the new, on the contrary,
they were directed against every one, without excepting even the King,
and therefore under certain circumstances even against him: and he
thought that the man who entered into such a League could be no good
subject. The demands moreover which were laid before him at the same
time, ran directly counter to the principles with which he started:
they annihilated the power of inflicting punishment, which had hitherto
been based upon the co-operation of royal with episcopal authority, and
transferred it to the General Assembly, which at the same time retained
an extremely strong lay element. This power of inflicting punishment
however, combined with the interpretation of the laws, constitutes
in a non-military state perhaps the most important attribute of the
sovereign. The idea of divine right and power from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> above to which Charles I adhered, was speedily and boldly met
by another theory, which, although it did not reject monarchy, yet in
substance undertook to build up the edifice of Church and State from
beneath.</p>

</div>


<p>King Charles thought that the Scots wished to give him somewhat of the
position of a Venetian Doge, but that he would not yet be reduced to
the necessity of complying. He was confident that he still had a party
of his own in Scotland.</p>

<p>The signature of the Scottish Covenant had run the natural course of
a great political party movement. The universal bias of men’s minds,
the esteem in which a few great names were held, the insistence of
active leaders, made up for any lack of conviction. A number of copies
on parchment, to which were appended the most influential names, were
set in circulation in the provinces: noblemen and important landed
proprietors canvassed for the signature of their friends: certain
objections were silenced by assurances of loyal intentions: here and
there recourse was had to threats, and even to active measures against
recalcitrants. Yet there were still many who refused to sign. They
felt themselves repelled by the violent character and method of the
proceeding, by the absence of higher authority, and by the comparison
of Anglican with Popish institutions; or else they had some regard for
the King: many indeed thought that Episcopalianism would still gain
the upper hand. The learned school of Aberdeen called attention to a
statute of 1585, which forbade all associations of which the King had
not been previously informed. One at least among the great nobles,
George Gordon, Marquess of Huntly, who had adopted the doctrines of
the episcopal system at the court of James I, adhered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> to the side of the crown in spite of all incentives to the
contrary. He said that his house had always been connected with the
royal family, and that it should stand or fall with it<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. And though
the Privy Council had at first promoted the movement by its connivance,
it immediately withdrew it, as soon as it was perceived that the centre
of gravity of ecclesiastical and political life was to be placed in the
General Assemblies independently of the government: from that time most
official persons severed themselves from the leaders of the nobility.
They thought that they would be able to resist the anti-monarchical
alliance which had been formed between the aristocracy and the popular
and religious elements, and to defeat it, if only the King would
show discretion at the right moment. They acted consistently with
their original position in asking him to do away with the two books
in which his system had reached its culminating point, and to modify
the Court of High Commission: as for the rest they only wished that
he should promise himself to take the grievances of the country into
consideration, and so remove them in accordance with the laws. Traquair
and his friends by no means wished for a General Assembly with such
extensive powers as the Covenanters demanded: they had reached a point
beyond which they did not mean to go.</p>

<p>Charles I at that time, to use an expression current even in England,
had formed a Junta to deliberate on the affairs of Scotland. It
consisted of Arundel, Cottington, the Secretaries Coke and Vane, and a
few Scots of high rank, the Duke of Lennox, the Earl of Morton and the
Marquess of Hamilton. Archbishop Laud was only now and then admitted
to take part in it, for the embarrassment of affairs in Scotland had
already entered on a stage in which principles at once episcopal and
monarchical were no longer a safe guide. Even in this Junta the views
of the Scottish statesmen asserted themselves: one of their number,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> Marquess of Hamilton, was selected, and
undertook to go to Scotland as Lord High Commissioner representing the
King, and to make an attempt to compose the disturbances on the basis
of concessions to be made by the King in accordance with the views of
the Scottish Privy Council.</p>

<p>Hamilton had lived at the English court from his youth. Early in life
he had married a niece of Buckingham, and, supported by this connexion,
in consequence of which his wife filled an important office at court,
had been brought into the closest relations with the royal family. The
King bestowed on him his unreserved confidence. He had once been warned
against Hamilton, who had an hereditary claim to the crown of Scotland:
the effect of this warning was that, the very next time he saw him,
he invited him to share the same sleeping apartment with himself on
the following night. Hamilton had given no special attention to study,
but he possessed natural gifts; a keen and solid understanding, sound
judgment, and imperturbable calmness in discussion: his counsels had
the greatest influence upon the King. In his political and even in his
personal attitude, he as well as the King was dependent upon the change
of circumstances. His mind had a natural tendency to conciliation
and compromise, in consequence of which he had supported John Dury,
who travelled about promoting with unwearied zeal the union of the
Protestant confessions. Devoted to the King, popular with the Scots,
averse from all extremes, he appeared to be the man best fitted to stem
the further progress of the quarrel that was every day becoming more
dangerous<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>In May 1638 James Marquess of Hamilton set out for Scotland. The royal
declaration seemed very well calculated to further his design. He
communicated it privately in the first instance, in order to found
his negotiations on it; and in the beginning of July he made it known
publicly. In it the King reasserted in the strongest terms that he
would adhere to Protestantism, and would not attempt to introduce any
innovation in Church and State in Scotland; that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> would no longer insist upon the reception of the Liturgy and
of the Book of Canons; that he would bring the High Commission into
harmony with the laws of Scotland, and would summon a General Assembly
and a Parliament at his earliest convenience<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. The Scottish
government expressed its thanks to the King for his assurances, and
the hope that his subjects would as was proper show themselves well
satisfied with these concessions.</p>

<p>In fact these concessions corresponded to the original intentions which
still prevailed in many quarters. Had the King’s instructions appeared
on the memorable 17th of October, things might have taken another turn.
But they could not satisfy those who on that day had revived their
complaint against the bishops with fresh vehemence, and had thereupon
signed the Covenant. They observed that the two books and the High
Commission were not actually abolished by the King’s concessions, still
less the Articles of Perth; that moreover no mention of their petition
was made by the King; that no notice was taken of the guilt of the
bishops, and that the time of summoning a General Assembly was left
unsettled.</p>

<p>Hamilton offered the malcontents to call an Assembly and a Parliament
at once, if they would renounce their Covenant and would deliver up the
original document. But how was it likely that that condition should be
secured? The zealous Scots declared that they would rather forswear
their baptismal obligations than the Covenant, the best document that
had been drawn up in Scotland since the fabulous days of Fergus. They
affirmed that it was a mistake on the King’s part to think that it
threatened his authority. They said that they acknowledged that their
weal depended on the weal of the King, who was set over them as God’s
vicegerent, to uphold religion and to administer justice.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy the religious zeal which was still coupled with
loyalty to the King, the Scottish Council hit upon the plan of
setting up in opposition to the Covenant of February<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> another which should emanate from the King himself. In this
the clauses referring to the latest measures of the government and
to the hostile feeling they had aroused, or implying the possibility
of offering resistance to the King himself, were to be left out, but
the anti-Catholic tone of the first was to be retained, and to be as
prominent as ever. The Scottish statesmen affirmed that if the two
books and the Articles of Perth were then recalled, the High Commission
dissolved, and the General Assembly acknowledged, there was ground for
entertaining not merely a hope but a confident expectation that general
contentment would revive in the nation, and that all opposition would
be put down at home: for that the movement in the nation had been
caused by anxiety about innovations opposed to Protestantism, not by
any feeling of disloyalty.</p>

<p>On the advice of the highest officials in Scotland and of his friend
Hamilton, the King conceded all these points. He consented to the
proposal for renewing the old Covenant of his father’s time: he wished
this to be signed at his own injunction, and a proclamation making new
concessions was published in Edinburgh on the 20th of September<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.
The Privy Council expressed its agreement with this proclamation, which
it characterised as the only thoroughly sufficient means of securing
Church and State. They thought that the King’s subjects should prove
their gratitude to him by hearty obedience, and that whoever henceforth
should venture to disturb the peace of the realm ought to be chastised
with all severity. The old Covenant was signed by the members of
the Privy Council, and was then transmitted to the King in proof of
re-established harmony. Proclamation was made with his sanction that a
free General Assembly should be held on the 21st of November following
at Glasgow, and a Parliament at Edinburgh in the May of the next year.</p>

<p>And in the nation these measures were received with hearty approval in
many quarters.</p>

<p>The provost, baillies and town council of Glasgow voted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1638.</span> the Lord High Commissioner an address of thanks for his
exertions, with which the clergy expressed their concurrence in glowing
terms. The University of Aberdeen had always condemned the Covenant
of the Lords, because it had been entered into without the consent
of the King. Its members signed the old Covenant without scruple;
certain restrictions were attached it is true, but such as betrayed a
leaning to episcopal government, and an aversion from the claims of the
national assemblies of the Church. Of the fifteen Judges of Session
who had been brought back again to Edinburgh by Hamilton’s means, nine
affixed their signature to the old Covenant. Even the Lord Advocate,
who had at first assisted the opposition by his advice, now affirmed
that the King’s declaration was the greatest piece of good fortune
which had befallen the Church of God since the Reformation.</p>

<p>And certainly from the point of view of religious controversy this
appeared to be the case. The King’s concessions only needed to be
maintained and to be confirmed in the popular assemblies appointed to
be held, in order to constitute a firm foundation for the freedom of
the Church and for that of the State, which was closely connected with
it. Charles I in these negotiations cannot be accused of obstinate
adherence to a foregone system. He granted everything which the Scots
had originally demanded.</p>

<p>This compliance however did not content them; and we cannot be very
much surprised that it did not. It is ever the rule that when political
parties are repelling an injury done them, peculiar tendencies of more
general application grow up in them. The development of strength, which
was necessary for obtaining some end, feels capable of asserting itself
in a yet wider sphere. Individual positions, which the holders will not
surrender, obligations to which those who undertook them will not prove
false, contribute to the same result. In Scotland at that time, Lord
Rothes, a man of easily excited popular and enterprising nature, found
himself, to his infinite satisfaction, at the head of a powerful and
constantly increasing party whose reverence he enjoyed. Lord Loudon,
who had not long left the schools, felt a natural satisfaction at the
scholastic element in the controversy, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> the
opposition of ideas, and the subtle distinctions and syllogisms which
it presented. The conflict which had been opened offered the widest
scope to his ambition, which had been repressed by his feelings of
loyalty<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. Hamilton represented to these noblemen that, after the
King had done so much for them, they also were bound to do something
for him. He thought that he might arrange with them what should be
brought forward and decided in the assemblies appointed to be held.
He demanded from them, if they would not go so far as to sign the old
Covenant, at least such a modification of the new Covenant as the King
could accept. But they declared that they would thus be themselves
condemning the oaths which they had taken, and induced others to take:
they did not deny that it would have been desirable for them to have
had the King’s authorisations for those signatures and oaths; but they
added that the less authority they had had, so much the less hypocrisy,
and so much the more truthfulness and freedom there had been. Extensive
alterations had followed from the acceptance of the Covenant: in
the presbyteries the moderators appointed under the influence of
the bishops had been again ejected: in an assembly of burghs the
resolution had been taken to retain no magistrate who had not signed
the new Covenant. They asked whether they were again to destroy what
they themselves had founded, and to break up the alliance which made
them powerful, and which gave them a better security than all the
proclamations of the King? For his concessions appeared only to have
been extorted by circumstances; they expected that when circumstances
altered, they would again be withdrawn.</p>

<p>And, moreover, the Scottish Covenanters had not yet reached their
ultimate aim. The design of abolishing episcopacy, of which they
had always been accused, but which they had hitherto, perhaps with
truth, disclaimed, was now become their conscious intention. The main
reason of their protest against the King’s proclamation was, that they
might not appear pledged to maintain the institution of episcopacy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> They now applied their whole influence to
prevent the signature of the royal Covenant.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing how completely aristocratic and religious
interests were blended on this occasion. In counties in which the great
lords were most powerful the Covenant of the King did not receive a
single signature. A prophetess arose who declared this Covenant to
be made by Satan, the people’s Covenant to be given from Heaven: and
her utterances found credit. The latter Covenant was indeed a logical
result of the great commotion, and conducted to further extremes the
enthusiasm out of which this commotion had arisen: the former was a
resource taken up under the pressure of circumstances, and gained no
confidence.</p>

<p>These influences had their effect on the elections to the General
Assembly which now came on. The committee of the Covenanters which
sat in Edinburgh exercised the greatest influence over them. Their
instructions to the presbyteries are extant, in which they caution them
to elect no one who had shared in the institution of bishops or in the
proceedings of the High Commission, or had acquiesced in the imposition
of the Liturgy: but on the other hand, to make provision in the proper
place for the election of members of the nobility and gentry belonging
to their party<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>; and generally to prepare carefully for the
elections, in order that the votes might not be split up. Even before
this time a dominant influence had often been exerted in the election
of representatives, for instance, in France, in the constitution of
the Assemblies of the League; but this was perhaps the first occasion
on which popular elections had been conducted by a committee with such
precise instructions. In the elections the adherents of the Covenant of
the nobles were completely victorious.</p>

<p>The Assembly of the Church which was opened on November 21, 1638, in
St. Mungo’s Cathedral, at Glasgow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> presented
a very extraordinary spectacle. On the floor of the church the lords
and gentlemen were seen sitting at a long table as the elected elders
of the Church; but their spiritual capacity did not prevent them from
wearing swords at their sides and daggers in their belts. Behind them
on benches, which rose as in an amphitheatre, sat the preachers:
separate galleries were erected for the public, for the nobility, and
the commons.</p>

<p>Hamilton had hoped to sever the interests of the ministers from those
of the lay elders, and to enlist the former body on the side of the
King. This sight was enough to teach him how greatly he had deceived
himself. He still thought that the elections most obnoxious to him,
which had not unfrequently been conducted in a disorderly manner, might
be set aside on a scrutiny. In fact, some elections were declared
invalid: but these were only cases in which men not partisans of the
Covenant had been chosen. The Assembly constituted itself entirely in
accordance with the views of the Covenanters. Henderson was nominated
moderator: Johnston who, as secretary of the Edinburgh Committee, had
had the greatest share in conducting the elections, was nominated
secretary of the Assembly.</p>

<p>Charles I had hoped that the General Assembly would be constituted
according to the forms in use when it had last met under his father,
when hardly anything had been heard of the lay elders. In that case it
might have been expected that episcopacy would be maintained, even if
it were made subject to the general representative body of the clergy.
But without applying to him for permission, an elder had been elected
to represent every presbytery, and that without regarding whether the
elder so elected was resident in the presbytery or not. The leaders of
the movement, who were the original promoters and subscribers of the
Covenant rejected by the King, and declared by him irreconcilable with
the duty of a subject, now confronted him as the most prominent members
of an Assembly invested with undefined right.</p>

<p>Everything had been already prepared beforehand in the Assembly for
taking the decisive step against the bishops. Just at the time of
the elections it had been recommended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> that
proofs of their guilt should be collected, and preparations made for
an abstract discussion on the nature of their office. The bishops now
handed in a declinatory on their part also, in which they especially
insisted on the point that an assembly composed for the most part
of laymen, had no longer an ecclesiastical character, and by the
ancient usages of the Church was incapable of sitting in judgment
on bishops. But in the prevailing state of opinion, how could any
regard be paid to this objection? The Moderator put the question to
the Assembly, whether they did not consider themselves nevertheless
as the legally-constituted tribunal for judging the bishops. The Lord
Commissioner would have allowed judicial proceedings to be taken
against the bishops, but only in a General Assembly summoned according
to the forms usually adopted of late, not in this Assembly, against
which he had protested from the beginning, and which every one knew to
be contemplating the entire abolition of episcopacy. He thought that
he could not await the issue of the voting. He once more explained why
he was obliged to declare the composition as well as the claim of the
Assembly to be illegal; and he then pronounced its dissolution in the
name of the King. But the Assembly was now in a humour which mocked at
the exercise of any authority on the part of the crown. Henderson said
that the Lord Commissioner might uphold the prerogative of his master
as much as he pleased; but that there was yet another prerogative, that
of the Church of God, and the General Assembly must take care of this.
He first put the question to the Assembly whether, in spite of the
declaration which they had heard from the Commissioner, they thought
of proceeding with their deliberations. Only some ten votes were given
in the negative. Then he returned to his former question, whether the
Assembly regarded itself as the tribunal which had jurisdiction over
the bishops; and this was answered unanimously in the affirmative<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>This took place in the seventh session of the Assembly, on November
28, 1638. On the 29th a proclamation from the King was read in the
Market-place of Glasgow, by which all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> further
meetings of the members of the illegal Assembly were forbidden, and
all resolutions which it might draw up were declared null and void.
The Assembly made answer on the same spot by means of a protestation,
in which they refused to allow this dissolution to take effect. One
of their reasons was the necessity in which they found themselves of
rejecting the Royal Covenant and of maintaining their own. The members
of the Privy Council had all of them signed the King’s proclamation:
only one name was missing, that of Lord Lorne, now Earl of Argyle,
one of those ambitious and capable men, who with sure instinct attach
themselves to the power which is strongest. He had chosen this moment
for passing over from the side of the royal Covenant to that of the
Covenant of the nobles and the people.</p>

<p>Thus these elements, whose previous struggles had still left a hope
of reconciliation, now opposed one another face to face in open and
irreconcilable hostility.</p>

<p>The intention originally professed was only that of abolishing the
arbitrary innovations of King Charles, and of returning to the
ordinances which James I had carried out in the General Assemblies
and Parliaments after his accession to the throne of England. But it
had always been the opinion of the staunch presbyterians, who dated
the decay of the Church from the rise of the royal influence, that
even this course should be opposed: and the ruling thought of the
Assembly at Glasgow was directed to the same end. Everything was there
declared invalid, which had been enacted in the Assembly of Linlithgow
in the year 1606 and in subsequent Assemblies. The two Books, the
High Commission, and with them also the Articles of Perth were not
merely rejected: it was declared a crime to have taken part in their
composition or introduction. Episcopacy was not only abolished on the
ground that it had no warrant in God’s Word, but it was abjured. Upon
the Bishops who had taken part in the ecclesiastical enactments of
the last ten years, sentence of excommunication and deposition was
pronounced; upon the others sentence of deposition alone. And how could
bishops and lay elders even exist side by side? The former exhibit the
authority of the Church as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> hierarchical; the
latter exhibit it as democratic in principle. The chief obstacle that
prevented the Kings from establishing the authority of the bishops was
in truth the independent origin of the Scottish national Church, and
the correspondence which existed in consequence between its fundamental
arrangements and this origin. The institution which they had wished to
make the basis of their influence over the Church was now shattered and
annihilated. The most important agencies affecting the state of affairs
were involved in the opposition between the bishops who supported
the crown, and the lay elders whose rights were bound up with the
congregation and with the subordinate temporal authorities.</p>

<p>We shall not, I think, go too far if we consider the Scottish General
Assembly at Glasgow, notwithstanding its original ecclesiastical
purpose, as nevertheless affording at the same time a type of
subsequent national assemblies which had a purely political aim. In
the conflict of opposite tendencies a party has here grown up which
enjoys general sympathy to a wide extent, and aims at effecting a
thorough transformation of the whole condition of Church and State:
the supreme authority is compelled by it to assent to the meeting of
an assembly able to bring about this result: this party controls the
elections, and by a definite organisation brings to pass a result
wholly in accordance with its wish: its leaders themselves are thus
invested with a public character: they obtain a position in which
they proclaim their intentions as the desire and will of the nation,
above all of the national Church, and are able to force them upon the
sovereign, whose ecclesiastical authority they repudiate. The moment
at which Henderson refused to dissolve the Assembly at the demand of
the King’s Commissary, however widely the circumstances may differ in
other respects, may well be compared with the first steps by which, a
century and a half later, the newly-created French National Assembly
for the first time withstood the commands of its King. The Assembly of
Glasgow held its sittings, carried on its deliberations, and drew up
resolutions after it had been dissolved by the King, and its continued
existence had been declared an act of treason. People realised quite
well what this state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> things meant<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. Into
the world, already filled with various fermenting elements, another
was introduced which, not only from its inherent nature, but from the
method in which it asserted itself, had, both here in Scotland and
everywhere else, a boundless prospect open before it.</p>

<span class="small">CAMPAIGN OF CHARLES I AGAINST SCOTLAND.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Some few score of years before these events, the Aragonese had rebelled
against Philip II for reasons similar to those for which the Scots
rebelled against Charles I. The pressure of the ecclesiastical and
temporal rule as exercised by that sovereign had made the Aragonese
anxious for their ancient liberties: the Inquisition was as much hated
by them as the High Commission by the Scots; and a trivial circumstance
had sufficed to cause the nobles, the hidalgos, and the towns to
revolt in quick succession. But Philip II had arrayed against the
Aragonese the power of his principal state of Castile, to the position
of which they feared to be reduced, had recovered their obedience by
force, had still more narrowly restricted their ancient liberties,
and had established the royal authority more firmly than any of his
predecessors had ever succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>The cause of the Scots involved yet more serious issues than that of
the Aragonese. If the Aragonese had been victorious, they would only
have revived within narrow territorial limits a representative Catholic
constitution, according to the ideas of the middle ages. The Scots on
the other hand repudiated everything which reminded them of the old
hierarchy and its alliance with the crown: they laid claim on religious
grounds to a political freedom such as had never yet existed in the
world.</p>

<p>So much the more did Charles I believe himself entitled to put an end
to this movement by force of arms. Even at the time when Hamilton first
went to Scotland, and expressed his anxiety lest he should be met by
protestations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> rebellious assemblies, the
King had plainly said that in such a case he might collect troops and
scatter the rebels. ‘But,’ rejoined Hamilton, ‘what if there be not
troops enough found in the country for this purpose.’ ‘Then,’ answered
the King, ‘power shall come from England, and I myself will come in
person with them, being resolved to hazard rather my life than to
suffer the supreme authority to be contemned.’ Hamilton had offered
far more than the King originally intended, but, in spite of all his
advances he had only awakened a more violent opposition. The letters
in which he announces this result strike a chord of self-reproach, we
might almost say of contrition, for he felt deeply that he had brought
the King into an almost untenable position. On his return he expressed
his conviction that the only course now open to the government was to
crush the rebels by force of arms. It was intended that Scotland should
be coerced by England, in the same way that Aragon had been coerced by
Castile.</p>

<p>In the Privy Council and among the friends of King Charles this design
was debated from various sides.</p>

<p>It was pointed out to him that a war between his subjects in the two
countries, whatever the issue might be, could only bring loss to him
who was King over both. And who, it was asked, could guarantee to him
that England would bestow the assistance of which he stood in need?
He would be conjuring up a storm which after such long years of peace
would burst forth with all the greater violence. How much better under
all circumstances was an agreement, more especially as mercy became a
king.</p>

<p>In answer to this by the other side, it was said that the agreement
must above all be such that the King should appear in it as master,
and should assert his importance. Of all misfortunes which a sovereign
could undergo, loss of authority was the worst; and the loss moreover
was most severe, when he had intended to make an alteration, and had
been compelled to withdraw it: the subject then became insolent, and
the sovereign fell into the plight of being no longer master, but
servant. What an unendurable position it would be to sit still and to
go on making concessions to men actually engaged in rebellion. Even a
serious war would be better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> than such a peace:
and if the King would surround himself with trusty counsellors, would
place the nobles under an obligation to his cause, be gracious to the
people, and then courageously take horse, everybody would follow his
example<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<p>Still further considerations, of a less general but of all the more
urgent character, are stated in the letters exchanged between the two
men to whom Charles I was accustomed to give most heed, Wentworth and
Laud. They found the reason of the embarrassment which had arisen in
Scotland, not in the King’s design itself, but in the want of proper
means for its execution. Wentworth said moreover, that if these rough
spirits were able to carry out their disorderly designs against the
honour of the King, the danger would be as great in England as in
Scotland: that the peace of the three kingdoms depended on the course
taken by this movement. Laud answers in similar terms. He adds, that
if the King did not defeat the Scots, a second confusion would arise
greater than the first, and that no one could see what this would bring
with it in its train<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<p>These two men were the principal supporters of the unparliamentary and
hierarchical system which the King had undertaken to enforce. From the
first moment they had felt the recoil of the Scottish movement upon
both the other kingdoms: they saw that the whole system as well as
themselves personally would be endangered by its progress: and they
were of opinion that their whole strength must be exerted to put an end
to it, cost what it may.</p>

<p>The assertion was advanced at this very time that an alliance between
the Scottish and English nobles had preceded the disobedience of the
former: that they had made an agreement in regular form to abolish
the episcopal constitution, and to curtail the prerogative of the
King<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span>

<p>But this is without doubt too strong a statement. The Scottish nobles
were aware of the discontent of a powerful party in England which was
excluded from the government. They may have reckoned upon it, but at
this time no proof is found of a formal agreement.</p>

<p>What is recorded of the alliance between the religious parties in the
two kingdoms with a view to common action has greater credibility.
A Scottish clergyman, who had long resided in London and returned
to Edinburgh in the year 1637, brought with him from the English
Nonconformists the assurance that as soon as anything was done in
Scotland something would be attempted in behalf of Presbyterianism in
England also. And, in fact, after the outbreak of the disturbances in
Edinburgh, Puritanism bestirred itself in London as well. In Cheapside,
Lambeth, and on the doors of St. Paul’s, placards were put up, in which
complaint was made against the Archbishop of Canterbury for shedding
the blood of the saints, and allowing Popish and Romanising tendencies
to have free play. It is remarkable what a reaction at first arose in
consequence. Archbishop Laud showed some courage in seizing that moment
for establishing the supremacy of Anglican orthodoxy over Catholicism
as well as over Puritanism. He had already long felt displeased at
being sometimes hindered by the influence of the court, or of certain
nobles, from enforcing the laws of the Church against Catholics as
well as against Protestants. He made a bold effort to show the world
that he was no Papist, and secured a decision in the Council that
the old edicts against recusants should be revived and put in force.
Catholic writings were again forbidden. Popish writers were treated
with a severity similar to that which had hitherto been shown towards
the Puritans. Laud himself had his old controversial writings against
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> Jesuits reprinted. Proclamations appeared
which, although more moderate in language than before, yet indicated
afresh that spirit of hostility to the Papacy which had originally
characterised the Anglican Church as well as other Protestant bodies.
Charles himself fully concurred in these proceedings. Cuneo had once
complained to him of the Archbishop, on the supposition that every
order proceeded from his individual determination. The King answered
that the other members of the Privy Council as well held the same
opinion. Cuneo took the liberty of reminding him of the conditions
of his marriage contract, by which he had assured the Catholics of
protection and care. ‘I shall never break these conditions,’ replied
the King, ‘but with your permission I will show that I really belong
to the religion which I profess. I know that the Pope wishes me to be
other than I am<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.’</p>

<p>There is as little truth in the assumption, which has been often made,
that the influence of Cuneo, and a tendency to Catholicism on his own
part, had kept back the King from doing justice to the demands of the
Scots. The King thought only of the supremacy of the Anglican Church:
the regard paid to Scotland operated at first even to the prejudice of
the Catholics, for the Archbishop wished above all to convince every
one that he had no leanings towards them. But if the King and the
Archbishop had hoped to calm men’s feelings by this means, they were
mistaken. The English Puritans, no less than the Scottish, considered
the demonstrations of the rulers of the Church against Catholicism a
mask which they would soon let fall again. They thought that if the
King wished to keep the Puritans in England in subjection, he must
first put down their fellow-believers in Scotland.</p>

<p>With the religious agitation in England moreover there was now
connected another of a civil character, which had reference principally
to the interpretation of the laws. Just during those months in which
the revolt in Scotland was gaining consistency, the question about
the legality of ship-money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> which, as has been
mentioned, the King allowed to be raised, came on for discussion before
the Judges of the Realm during the term of their regular session,
from the autumn of 1637 to the summer of 1638. Who does not know the
passionate interest which is wont to attend proceedings of the higher
courts of justice when they bear on unsettled political questions? This
was strengthened by the compulsory exaction of the tax which went on
simultaneously with the discussion of the point at issue. The Judges,
who declared themselves in favour of the legality of the tax, incurred
hatred and obloquy. But there were two of them. Crooke and Hutton, who
pronounced against it. Their arguments agreed with the assumptions made
by public opinion. They affirmed that the right to which the crown laid
claim belonged to it only in very exceptional cases, and then only
with the reserve of the subsequent consent of Parliament; but that in
the present case such an extraordinary necessity had not arisen, and
Parliament had now for some years not been summoned. The two judges
contested the precedents adduced by the other party in favour of its
own view: they looked upon the question as a simple controversy between
legal justice and authority; and they threw themselves without reserve
on the side of the former.</p>

<p>This however was no reason why the sentence of the majority of the
judges may not have been consistent with former ordinances. The
refusals of payment were condemned as illegal; but nevertheless the
proofs alleged by the two dissentients had made an indescribable
impression<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>The government did not allow itself to be driven from its course in
either of the affairs in which it was engaged. It both kept down the
English Puritans, and continued to collect the tax to which exception
was taken. But opposition and agitation increased daily in the country.
The Scots stirred up this feeling with various pamphlets. They sought
to make the English conscious that the cause of both countries was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> the same. And their example itself produced
a still greater effect. From time to time anxiety was felt lest the
Scottish uprising should spread over England<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<p>While already, apart from other considerations, there was much to be
said for the necessity of contending against the rising in Scotland
in open war, it was also seen that the same course was necessary for
the preservation of order in England. Hamilton, the mediator of peace,
who had returned from Scotland after failing in his attempt, the
Lord Deputy of Ireland, and the Primate of the English Church united
their voices in favour of war. Without doubt their counsels were what
determined the King.</p>

<p>But it is also clear that no one could think of claiming the help of
the English Parliament in the conduct of this war, however important
it might have been under other circumstances. The King indignantly
rejected the advice to summon a Parliament; for what could he have
found in that body but a combination of Puritans and men who had
refused to pay ship-money, with those who supported on principle the
rights and claims of Parliament? His intention was to carry on the war
upon the strength of the prerogative of the crown with those forces
which his income, that had just now been increased, as well as the
voluntary offerings of the friends of his system should supply.</p>

<p>And his position in general depended upon his success in this
undertaking. If the enterprise against Scotland prospered, the validity
of the prerogative in England also was for ever established. The King’s
hierarchical and monarchical system of government would have acquired
double force through a victory won by his own strength. Thus in former
times Philip II had first become completely master of his own kingdom
by his victory over the Aragonese.</p>

<p>Charles I was not without a prospect of a like success.</p>

<p>Large sums were brought in by those contributions which the most
eminent members of the English clergy, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> the bishops, agreed to make: for not only was the cause of the
King in substance their own, but they wished besides to distinguish
themselves by giving proof of loyalty. At the special request of the
Queen the Catholics, who were again relieved from the burden of those
oppressive measures lately mentioned, gave something, though not indeed
very much, nor very willingly; for though they wished to acquire the
favour of the King, on whom their very existence depended, they yet
feared the vengeance of the enemy in case of a reaction. Among the high
nobility also the King and his cause had some ardent adherents of both
sexes who made large contributions.</p>

<p>Those feelings of personal dependence on the hereditary sovereign,
which were the cement that bound together states of Germanic and Latin
origin, were on the whole not yet extinguished in England. On the
King’s declaration that he would display his standard in the spring
at York, many gave in their names as volunteers. The gentry in the
northern counties especially showed zeal and devotion. The militia was
everywhere put under arms. In April we find an army of about 20,000
men, horse and foot, assembled around the King.</p>

<p>The army was not intended strictly speaking to invade Scotland. The
plan, in the formation of which as in other matters the Marquess of
Hamilton had great influence, contemplated only measures of coercion
against the Covenanters. And as their principal strength was thought to
lie in the town-populations, and the towns lived principally by trade,
especially by trade with Holland, he had taken up the opinion that they
would be compelled to submit, if they were cut off from this commerce.
He went himself with an English squadron to the Frith of Forth in order
to carry out this measure. The land-army was intended only to make
a demonstration in his support, and above all to secure the Border
against an incursion which the Scots might otherwise feel tempted to
make.</p>

<p>Another design was entertained, which is worth mentioning, although it
was not carried into effect. A couple of thousand experienced troops,
made up of cavalry and infantry, especially arquebusiers, were to be
transferred from the Spanish to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> English
service; and the Spaniards were to be allowed in return to enlist
a corresponding number in the British dominions. These were to be
conveyed to Scotland in Flemish ships, but at the cost of the English,
and to be stationed in Edinburgh Castle either by amicable means or by
force. From this point they were to be put into communication with the
royalists in the northern counties, especially with Huntly, and with
the town of Aberdeen. The power of the King would have become so strong
in Scotland itself, that, under the influence of coercive measures
adopted simultaneously by sea and land, the Covenanters in the capital
and in the southern counties might well have been expected to consent
to such an agreement as the King desired<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<p>The prospect of a very widely extended alliance between various
elements of strength had thus been opened: but to secure their
co-operation, which was naturally difficult to bring about, diplomatic
negotiations of the most prolix character with the courts of Brussels
and Madrid were also necessary. While the King was still engaged upon
them the Scots on their side were already making preparations for
resistance.</p>

<p>But if success depended upon bringing over experienced troops from the
Continent to Great Britain, this was far easier for the Scots than for
the English. We have already mentioned in what numbers the Scots served
under the Swedish flag in Germany<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. If the Protestant cause which
they defended in Germany were now to be fought for and carried through
in their own native country, how could they hesitate to return thither?
The heads of their families, for whom they still cherished an inborn
attachment, now themselves summoned them home.</p>

<p>Among the Scots in the Swedish service Alexander Lesley had acquired
a very distinguished position. He commanded the first troops which
Gustavus Adolphus threw into Germany: he it was who, by crossing to
occupy Rügen from Stralsund,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> had opened the
Swedish war in Germany<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. In the school of Gustavus Adolphus he
learned to exercise the command-in-chief of an army in troublous
circumstances. Chancellor Oxenstierna, who made him a field-marshal,
afterwards employed him in the most difficult political and military
enterprises. His exertions in the years 1635 and 1636 had almost
the greatest share in establishing the Swedish supremacy in Western
Pomerania. Even in Germany however he had been deeply affected by the
disagreements between Scotland and England. The views of King Charles,
which were at that time represented by Hamilton, when he appeared with
the King of Sweden in order to bring about the restoration of the
Palatinate, were distasteful to the Scottish troops: they wished to
see their King a decided enemy of Spain and Austria. The Field-Marshal
might consider that he was merely executing a flank movement in the
great war if he went to Scotland and assumed the chief command of
his countrymen, who now opposed the doubtful policy of their King,
and undertook to maintain their religious and political independence
against him. He had moreover a special inducement for going, because
Lord Rothes, the head of the Lesleys, was the foremost leader of the
movement. People had at first thought that the plain-looking man of
mean origin and small stature, with a lame foot and already advanced
in years, would secure little consideration among the proud and
magnificent nobles. But what is more irresistible in the world than
military experience, and more captivating than fame for generalship?
Everything was swayed by his counsels. Following his example others
also gave up far more lucrative and important positions in the German
War in order to serve their country, so that a staff of captains and
under-officers was soon formed who rendered the greatest service in
training troops<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. From their fellow-believers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> Holland the Scots obtained munitions, and even some pieces of
ordnance.</p>

<p>It was important for the Scots in the first place to guard against,
or to render impossible, any hostile attempt on the part of England.
Under Lesley’s guidance they turned their arms against the Castle
of Edinburgh: the gate was blown open with a petard. Dalkeith and
Dumbarton were taken possession of in like manner: the intended
enlistment of Spanish troops was still far from being effected, when
the royalists in the north of Scotland were compelled to submit, Huntly
was taken prisoner in violation of a promise made to him, and was
brought to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the beginning of May, Hamilton appeared with his squadron
in the Frith. Beacons upon the neighbouring heights proclaimed his
approach to the country, and the whole people hastened in arms to
both shores in order to prevent his landing. It is not clear whether
he seriously intended to land. He contented himself at present with
occupying the small islands of Inch-Keith and Inch-Colm, and of there
stopping the Scottish vessels that were passing by. He did not let them
go until the crews swore to him that they would stand by the King.</p>

<p>But the royal army also, under the command of the Earl of Arundel, had
already arrived at the border. With a force the strength of which is
rated at 20,000 men, and which was superior, at least in infantry, to
that of the King Lesley advanced to meet him: he set up his camp at
Dunse Hill immediately under the eyes of the King.</p>

<p>After the example of Gustavus Adolphus and Bernard of Weimar, Alexander
Lesley also took pains that the aspect of the camp should correspond
to the religious motives of the expedition, and nowhere could men’s
feelings have been better prepared beforehand for such a proceeding
than in Scotland. The soldiers were heard singing psalms or reading
the Scriptures in their tents: the ministers were girded with swords
or carried carbines: the more fiery their discourse, the more devoutly
they were listened to. But whilst the Scots were opposing their King
under arms, they did not wish to wear the appearance of being at war
with him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> They sometimes gave him a cheer:
on the flags were to be read the words ‘For God, the King, and the
Covenant.’ They did not wish to fight against the King, but against the
bishops, by whom he was thought to be misled: they would not let their
influence, so ruinous to Church and State, rise again, at least in
Scotland.</p>

<p>How entirely different was the appearance which the English camp
presented!</p>

<p>It was not merely that but few of the leaders had ever seen war: the
soldiers were unaccustomed to strict discipline, and did not render to
their officers that punctual obedience which military service requires.
The Scottish soldier had few wants<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>; sufficient supplies had been
provided from the capital: the English soldier had many wants; but
the delivery of supplies was irregular. When the King showed himself
they even cried out for bread. No trace was to be found among them of
the military spirit of the time; and how should the episcopal system
have been capable of calling out a religious zeal corresponding to the
Puritan enthusiasm?</p>

<p>Charles I moreover had not been able to assemble, even for a military
expedition, so many men of importance without bringing to light the
political opposition with which he had to struggle. The Lords of the
Opposition had not appeared with the arms and followers which they
had been expected to bring. The King sought to assure himself of
their obedience by means of an oath, in which they were to vow to
serve obediently against all seditious combinations, even if they
were formed under pretence of religion. Lords Brooke and Say and Sele
refused to take this oath. The King, who when in the field demanded
the absolute submission of his vassals, had them arrested; but on
this a general disturbance arose in the camp. Their friends took the
ground that the King had no right at all to demand a new oath, which
had not been approved beforehand by Parliament. The rest of the lords
went to the Earl of Arundel with a request that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> would put himself at their head in order to represent this to
the King<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. Arundel called their attention to the danger which would
thus arise to the King’s service, and promised them redress for their
grievances. Legal authorities in London gave it as their opinion that
the prosecution against the two lords could not be proceeded with. They
were accordingly, after some days, set at liberty again.</p>

<p>Thus much at least was by this means made plain to every one,—that
there could be no thought of an unanimous and decisive prosecution of
the war in favour of the King’s prerogative, as connected with the
authority of the bishops. The state of religious opinion shook the
loyalty of obedience. The views of the Scots had penetrated even among
those who were to have fought against them.</p>

<p>The Scots also on their part had reasons for not driving matters to
extremities. An open conflict with the King would have fanned into
bright flame the opposition in the North, which had hardly been
quelled, and which was already stirring again, so that it would have
been necessary to detach a military force to that quarter; and, as has
been mentioned, such a conflict was no part of their original intention.</p>

<p>Hamilton had not long been stationed in the Frith when some of the
leading Covenanters presented themselves for a conference with him,
in which they offered to pay every kind of civil obedience to their
sovereign, provided that they could obtain satisfaction as to their
ecclesiastical institutions<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. Hamilton applied to the King in
reference to these proposals, and as from the beginning Charles had
not intended to subdue the Scots by force, but only by taking arms to
compel them to show greater compliance in negotiation, he now acceded
to their proposals. On a further application, and on the appearance of
symptoms of returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> obedience in the army
encamped over against him, he issued a safe conduct to his own camp for
the four deputies whom the Scots appointed, that they might lay their
demands before a commission nominated by himself.</p>

<p>The two armies had advanced into the field to meet one another, and lay
encamped against one another in open hostility; but in temper they were
not altogether opposed. In the one, obedience to the King had not yet
been entirely thrown off: in the other it still reigned, but no longer
in full strength. How then could men on both sides not hesitate before
they caused fresh bloodshed between two nations of common descent, who
had been closely connected together for the last century? Instead of
fighting they began to negotiate. We must now turn our attention, not
to deeds of war, but to arguments and counter-arguments advanced before
an assembled council.</p>

<p>The royal commission was composed of men of very different views. With
Arundel, in whose tent the meetings were held, sat Essex and Holland:
among the Scots were seen some of the former champions of the movement,
Rothes and Loudon. The negotiations began on June 11. Hardly had
Arundel formally opened the conference when the King appeared in order
to conduct his cause in person, for he could not let it be said of him
that he was unwilling to listen to his subjects.</p>

<p>The Scots affirmed that their proceedings were in accordance with the
acknowledged and written laws of the country. The King denied this:
for how indeed could it be said that the last Assembly at Glasgow had
been elected or held according to legal forms? In consequence of this
he was also unable to regard their decisions as legal or to ratify
them. He assured them that he had no intention of altering anything in
the matter of religion or law which had been laid down by sovereign
authority: but if he said one thing and they another, who, he asked,
was to judge between them: who was to fix the sense of the laws?</p>

<p>This in fact was the question at issue. He had intended to decide
it in his own favour by superiority of arms, and to break down the
political and military opposition in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> the
Scots had engaged. As he had not succeeded in doing this, while at the
same time matters had not gone so far as to compel him to an absolute
surrender—for at all events he had achieved one object, and had in the
first place secured England against an invasion of the Scots, which had
been feared—no final accommodation could be expected.</p>

<p>The Scots declared in writing that their wishes were only directed
to the maintenance of religion and liberty in accordance with the
ecclesiastical and political laws of the country: that they would never
desire anything which was not laid down in these; and that they were
ready as loyal subjects to obey the King. Charles I replied, that if
such were their wishes, they were also his own.</p>

<p>A movement towards an approximation now took place, in which however
each side reserved to itself its own views as to what the laws really
contained.</p>

<p>The agreement which was arrived at after some days (June 17), the
so-called Pacification of Berwick, arranged that the Scottish army
should be disbanded, the English fleet withdrawn from the Frith, the
King’s castles with their ammunition restored to him, and that any
vessels that had been detained should be returned to the Scots<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.
The King consented that in the following August first a free General
Assembly, and immediately afterwards a Parliament also, should be
held; that they should henceforward be regularly summoned, and that
the one should have the decision of ecclesiastical, the other that
of temporal affairs. He did not however consent to acknowledge the
last Assembly at Glasgow as legal, from considerations, as was said
in the proclamation, which were imposed upon him by the sovereign
power which had descended to him from his ancestors. What were these
considerations? Even if Charles I allowed everything which he or his
father had lately introduced to be swept away, yet he would not permit
that any part of it should be declared illegal or papistical. He would
not allow the reproach of having ordained anything illegal to fall
either on himself or on his father. He assented to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1638.</span> the most important enactments of the Assembly at Glasgow; he
assented provisionally even to the abolition of episcopacy; but he
held to the view that the Assembly had been illegally summoned, and
was illegal: that which might be reaffirmed in a new assembly approved
by him, and that only, would he then ratify. In other matters also
he clung with similar inflexibility to his conception of the supreme
power which must remain in his hands. He was ready to allow periodical
ecclesiastical and temporal assemblies to meet. His commissary was to
be instructed to proclaim the meeting of such an assembly again within
a year; but it appeared to him insufferable that he should be pledged
to do this for all future time. If he allowed that his veto should not
be exercised with regard to their next proceedings, he was yet resolved
not to allow himself to be robbed of this veto for ever. But these
are just the most important questions which arise as to parliamentary
or representative forms of government. How could it be expected that
the strong opposition between royal authority and the independence of
parliamentary and ecclesiastical assemblies which was implied in these
questions, and which had deep root in Scotland especially, should so
easily be brought to a settlement without a real and strenuous conflict.</p>

<p>The news of the Pacification of Berwick was received with great
satisfaction, especially in the Protestant world. That the Scots had
not been overpowered appeared of itself to be an advantage; but it was
thought moreover that King Charles would desire to give employment to
the Scots in order to keep them obedient; and where else could that
employment be found but in the German war? It is affirmed that Lesley
offered him to lead his troops immediately to the Continent for the
reconquest of the Palatinate; that he did not require the King to
bear any other cost but that of their transport; for Lesley intended
to maintain his Scots in Germany as Mansfeld and Wallenstein had
maintained their troops<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. King Charles is said to have entered
for a moment into this plan. The rejection of his last overtures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> by Austria appeared to justify it, and no doubt
all his affairs might, had he accepted the proposal, have assumed a
different aspect. But so bold and reckless an enterprise was repugnant
to his character. After some reflection he put it aside. Apart from his
fears of strengthening his opponents at home, his relations with France
and Spain were not in such a condition that he could throw his weight
decisively into the scale.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="small">RELATIONS OF THE ENGLISH COURT WITH THE COURT AND POLICY OF FRANCE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Let us now once more direct our close attention to the relations
between England and France, which at that time, as they had almost
always done, determined the general course of European policy.</p>

<p>In July 1637 the two powers, between which, notwithstanding the
above-mentioned objections on the part of Wentworth, negotiations had
always been going on, came to an agreement about the articles of an
alliance for mutual assistance, which opened a wide prospect for the
general relations of Europe, especially with regard to Germany<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<p>By this agreement they combined in proposing to restore the Estates of
the German Empire, which had been overpowered by the house of Austria,
and especially the Palatine house, to those possessions and rights
which they had enjoyed before the war. The King of England pledged
himself that he would not permit either money or the necessaries of
war to be supplied in future to the Austro-Spanish house, but on the
contrary, that he would equip a fleet which should entirely prevent any
transport of the kind: that he would never again allow the Spaniards
to enlist soldiers in his dominions, but that he would give this
permission to the French. In return the King of France promised not
to conclude peace either with the German or with the Spanish line of
the house of Austria without the consent of the King of England, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> above all not to do so unless the complete
restoration of the Palatinate had been obtained. In order to achieve
this end, their allies, Holland and Sweden, were to be invited, in
common with the two Kings, to lay before the house of Austria and the
Duke of Bavaria conditions for a general agreement, and were to enforce
these by arms if they were not accepted within a month. The two Kings
were then to sanction any kind of enterprise on the part of their
subjects against the possessions of the crown of Spain in America, in
the East Indies, or in Europe: they were to cut off the communications
of Spain with the distant parts of the world, as well as with Flanders
and Germany; and they were to settle beforehand how to deal with the
conquests which they hoped to make in the Spanish Netherlands.</p>

<p>On the last point negotiations had not yet led to any agreement.
Charles I had demanded that if Dunkirk, or other places in the
Netherlands, were conquered, they should then be handed over as a
pledge to his nephews, the Princes Palatine. The French, on the
contrary, adhered to their intention of erecting in the conquered
Netherlands either a Catholic republic, or a government under the
common sovereignty of the allies, like the bailiwicks in Switzerland.
In the further progress of the negotiations Charles I expressed
himself at last not disinclined to assent to a government in the form
of a common sovereignty. All points in the agreement were to be again
deliberated on in a congress of the powers at Hamburg, and to be there
brought to a settlement.</p>

<p>Thus matters were settled after long negotiation. When we read the
articles it is hard not to believe that a powerful joint effort for
restoring the former condition of affairs was to be made without delay.</p>

<p>A closer consideration of the circumstances however shows beforehand
that on neither side was there a decided intention of making such an
effort.</p>

<p>The French were convinced that Charles I wished for the continuance
of the war between France and Spain in order that meanwhile he might
revive his naval power, recover his lost reputation, and enrich his
country; but that he was so fettered by the profitable relation which
he secretly maintained with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> the Spaniards
that he would never proceed boldly to fight for the interests of the
Palatinate: that, if he now seemed inclined for an agreement with
France, he was only trying to induce the house of Austria by arousing
anxiety as to his alliance, to make some trivial concessions to his
nephews with which he would be content. The obligation of keeping up
a fleet on the coasts, which Charles undertook by the treaty, was
considered by the French far too contemptible considering the greatness
of the cause which the two powers upheld.</p>

<p>Why then, we may ask, did the circumspect Cardinal Richelieu consent
to this alliance? His anxieties were the reason for his conduct: he
wished to keep King Charles from allying himself more closely with the
house of Austria. He put off the definitive conclusion of the treaty
until the conference at Hamburg, because he foresaw that it would
encounter obstacles there and be delayed. In the summer of 1637 the
articles had been laid down: in the autumn of 1637 Richelieu gave to
Bellièvre, the President of the Parliament, who went as ambassador to
England, instructions not indeed to conclude anything, for this was
far from his intention, but only to keep Charles I in the belief that
France wished for the conclusion of the treaty, and that she would
promote it at Hamburg. Meanwhile he was to induce that sovereign to
throw more obstacles in the way of intercourse between Spain and the
Netherlands<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. In February 1638 the Council of State, which worked
under Richelieu’s directions, once more considered the treaty. Father
Joseph, who sat in this council, proposed to insert the condition that
the King of England should employ his ships not only for the protection
of his own coasts, but for the attack of the coasts of the Spanish
Netherlands, or of the Spanish peninsula<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. The other members
agreed, but went a step further still: they demanded that a joint
attack should be made upon some place or other in the Netherlands, to
be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> precisely determined by and by: they
thought that it was in the highest degree unjust that England should
not support the French, and yet should wish to prevent them from
conquering Dunkirk for instance. They thought, moreover, that any share
in governing the conquered territory after the fashion of the Swiss
bailiwicks could be allowed to England only if that power itself took
an active share in the conquest. But however much stress the French
laid upon this co-operation, they nevertheless also thought right not
to break off negotiations, if Charles I should still be inclined again
to defer his answer.</p>

<p>But if we ask what views Charles I really cherished, it is plain that
he would never have consented to engage in direct hostilities against
the strong places in the Netherlands. He might possibly have allowed
an attack to be made by the Dutch and French, supposing that he were
to have a share in the government of the conquered places, but he
would never have taken part in such an attack. In the summer of 1637,
whilst he was acceding to the preliminary stipulations with France,
the Spaniards made advances to him on the other side, and, to say the
least, he did not reject their overtures. He treated the Spanish court
at all times with the greatest respect. In 1638 the Elector Palatine
had been placed in a position to appear in some force in Westphalia:
the King of England had assurances given to the Spaniards that this was
not his doing, although on the other hand he was not opposed to it; but
that he looked upon it as an exclusively German affair, which had no
reference to the Spanish crown. He assured them that his wishes were
only directed to the restoration of general peace in Christendom, in
which every one should again enjoy his own.</p>

<p>Cardinal Richelieu may have been quite right in his opinion that the
main object of the King of England in his stipulations with France
was to compel the Spaniards to show greater compliance in the affair
of the Palatinate than had been displayed at the time of Arundel’s
mission<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. But that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> however was not the
only reason why the projected agreement could not be executed. During
the negotiations of the allies as to the agreement on proposals to
be made to the house of Austria, England, as it had intimated to the
Spaniards, expressed the opinion that each one ought to have his own,
and therefore that not only the Palatinate, but everything else which
had been taken from its rightful owner, must be given up. Cardinal
Richelieu was agitated by this proposal, for he thought that the
house of Austria might well accede to it, but that it was impossible
for France and for Sweden to do so; and that the consequence of the
negotiations would be that they would lose England as their ally, whom
they had hoped to gain<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>The negotiations underwent fluctuations which were often of a petty
character. Neither side was altogether in earnest in them: but
notwithstanding these uncertainties and the momentary complications
which crossed them, the great interests at stake and the opposition
between them came under discussion. The opposition arose from the
dislike of Charles I to allow either the acquisition of Lorraine
by France or the exclusive occupation of the strongholds in the
Netherlands by the arms of France and Holland, without any advantage or
participation on his part, and his equal dislike to the establishment
of the Swedes in Pomerania. His wishes and, in regard to the
Palatinate, his interests also were engaged in bringing about the
restoration of the old distribution of territory in the German empire,
not merely however with reference to the Princes and the estates which
had been injured by Austria and Bavaria, but with reference to those
also which had suffered from Sweden and France. This was a scheme which
even at the present day might awaken a certain feeling of sympathy
for King Charles, especially in Germany: had it been carried out,
the maintenance of the balance of power in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span>
Europe would still have been possible. But for that object far other
efforts would have been needed than those which he could make, and
far other resources than those which he could wield, but above all an
energetic and always decided policy. The first result was that even
the suggestion of those ideas in France, where the very designs were
entertained which he wished to defeat, made the conclusion of the
projected treaty impossible.</p>

<p>The political difference was aggravated by personal misunderstandings
springing from those divisions which at that time were agitating the
court and kingdom of France. It is indispensable in this place to
bestow a word upon them.</p>

<p>The marriage of Charles I with a French princess had been desired on
the part of the English in the year 1624, because they thought by this
means to find support against other enemies: for the Queen-mother Mary
de’ Medici, in concert with Cardinal Richelieu, still ruled at the
French court, and there was every appearance that her dominion was
likely long to endure. She herself had promoted the alliance because
she wished to see her daughters the consorts of the neighbouring
sovereigns of Spain, Piedmont, and England: she thought by this means
to acquire a personal influence in all the important affairs of Europe.</p>

<p>But then followed an epoch in which the interests of the dynasty began
to be thrown into the background by the interests of the state. While
Mary de’ Medici sought to maintain the former in her dealings with
Spain, and to be just to that country, in spite of all other disputed
questions, she fell out with Richelieu, who supported the principle
of the power of the sovereign, to which he wished to give effect in
France, by the principle of the exclusive ascendancy of that country
abroad, in favour of which he enlisted the sympathies of Louis XIII.
The mother of the King was obliged to give way to his minister. The
‘Day of Dupes,’ though it appeared like an act of a comedy, was
nevertheless a great event both for France herself, and for all her
relations with other countries.</p>

<p>The quarrels between the Queen-mother and the Cardinal, her subsequent
flight, and her attempt to return in conjunction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1629.</span> with her second son and a strong native party, but at the same
time with foreign aid as well, reacted upon those countries in the
west and south, with whose reigning families she was allied, and on
which she sought to support herself. Her daughters—who could wonder at
it?—took part with their mother.</p>

<p>The English court had scarcely attained a certain measure of domestic
repose, when it was acted upon by these divisions of the French court,
and even drawn into them.</p>

<p>In the year 1629 the Marquess of Chateauneuf was
ambassador-extraordinary at the English court. In public he attached
himself to the policy of Richelieu, to whom he owed his advancement;
and he sought to bring about an union between France and England
against the house of Austria. He gave satisfaction to the Cardinal in
the conduct of affairs, so that after the fall of Marillac the great
seal was entrusted to him. But, as is mentioned in the instructions
to the next French ambassador, Poigny, Chateauneuf at that time was
already secretly labouring to poison the mind of the English Queen
against the Cardinal<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. He had succeeded in acquiring the confidence
of Henrietta Maria: it was also affirmed that he had formed a connexion
with the Chevalier Jars who stood, through the medium of a lady of the
bedchamber, high in her favour, and that Henrietta had been estranged
from the French policy of the time and from the Cardinal. But how much
easier must it have become to produce an effect of this kind after the
scenes at the Luxemburg and the flight from Compiègne? Chateauneuf
carried on a correspondence which, being sometimes intercepted,
revealed his unbounded ambition.</p>

<p>Chateauneuf at that time stood in intimate relation with the notorious,
perhaps still beautiful, certainly seductive and ever excitable Madame
de Chevreuse. We cannot say whether she, like many other French
ladies of that time, formed connexions from inclination uncontrolled
by any regard to prudence, or from policy directed to very different
ends.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span> As Marie de Rohan she had already a
very important position in the world, through her descent from a
family related to the house of Bourbon, and itself among the most
distinguished in France. Owing to the influence of her first husband,
the Constable Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII, she was appointed
Mistress of the Household to the young queen Anne, whose favour she
completely won as she cheered her otherwise melancholy days. After the
early death of the Constable she married, while still quite young, the
Duke of Chevreuse, son of the greatest of the antagonists of Henry
IV, that Henry of Guise who was murdered at Blois. She thus became a
member of the house of Lorraine, which at that time was endangered by
Richelieu’s policy, and formed the centre of the European political
combinations which countermined him. It was the chief ambition of the
Duchess of Chevreuse to oppose the Cardinal, just because he was so
powerful and was daily becoming more so, and because he imposed upon
each and every one his own will as law. Her rank, her position, her
connexions, her personal charms, resistless to the young and even to
older men, gave her a variety of constantly fresh means of fomenting
this opposition. She had already had the principal share in the
conspiracy of Ornano: the unfortunate Chalais fell a victim to her; for
no one could approach her without suffering for the connexion. At that
time the Keeper of the Great Seal had the highest place in her regard,
a man of adroitness and of great attainment, of industry and ability,
who seemed well fitted to become the successor of the Cardinal, if he
should once be overthrown. Richelieu accuses him of having betrayed to
the lady the decisions of the Council, which had been directed against
Lorraine. And as the Duchess of Chevreuse also had relations with the
Queen of England, whom she had known from her youth, these machinations
extended even across the Channel<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. The attention of Richelieu was
called by people in England to the efforts made to overthrow him,
and to put Chateauneuf in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1633.</span> place. Queen
Henrietta was said to have given out ‘that Chateauneuf, who was her
friend, and had no share in the pernicious designs of the Cardinal,
would manage the affairs of France better than he.’ Even in matters of
religion Chateauneuf preferred to oppose the views of the Cardinal.
But these projects were not restricted in their application to the
administration of France. We have mentioned the various enmities which
the Lord Treasurer Weston had to encounter at the English court. They
originated to a great extent with the Queen, who would have wished to
bring her friend the Earl of Holland, the friend of Chateauneuf, to the
head of affairs<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. Richelieu and Weston, although in other respects
much unlike, yet resembled one another in this:—they both had no other
interest in view than the extension of the royal power, which put out
of sight all personal considerations. It was intended to overthrow
them both, and to replace them by more accessible men, who belonged
to a different system. With this object was connected the design of
restoring the Queen-mother in France, and with her the line of policy
common to the Austro-Spanish party and to that of Lorraine.</p>

<p>In the midst of this net of political entanglements and intrigues King
Charles remained calm and unconcerned. He took pains to hinder the
threatened outbreak of factious violence, despite of which he knew how
to support his minister.</p>

<p>In France such proceedings were taken as were usual at that time.
Chateauneuf and Jars were arrested in February 1633: the former, whom
his enemies wished still to spare, was sent to prison at Angoulême;
against the latter criminal proceedings were instituted. He was
condemned to death, reprieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> only upon
the scaffold, and then thrown into the Bastille. All their friends
experienced a similar fate, except such as were able to save themselves
by flight. Madame de Chevreuse was banished first to Dampierre; and as
she sometimes came thence to Paris in order to see the Queen, she was
sent before the end of a twelvemonth to Tours, where she spent four
long years.</p>

<p>From that place, so far as the secrecy enjoined by her dangerous
position allowed, she kept up a very extensive correspondence with
friendly members of the various courts, and received messages from the
Duke of Lorraine. In the year 1637 Richelieu came upon traces of the
share which the consort of his sovereign took in these and similar
combinations. But he had no mind to suffer any deviation from the
policy to which he adhered, in any member of the court. Queen Anne had
established a correspondence with the Cardinal-Infant, which she used
to conduct by means of English agents in Paris and at the Hague. She
was forced to confess her guilt, and was then pardoned, but only upon
promising to renounce for ever all intercourse of this sort. Madame de
Chevreuse, who knew that she was involved in this discovery, in order
to avoid arrest, fled to Spain in the disguise of a young cavalier, as
suited her bold and adventurous character.</p>

<p>The Queen of England, who had no share in these matters, sided at that
time in her political leanings with France. The ambassadors report how
sensible she was of every token of friendly feeling exhibited by her
brother and the Cardinal, and how she at times even resisted proposals
made by Spain<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. After the death of Weston she acquired more
importance, as the King exhibited a passionate and growing attachment
to her, and it was thought that she would turn it to the advantage of
France, if she were properly advised. In Bellièvre’s despatches it was
said that the Queen was well disposed, but still had slight influence;
and that nothing more must be desired of her than she herself thought
expedient for maintaining the good understanding between the two
crowns:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> that perhaps an opportunity would soon
arise when she could do more<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. The Cardinal thought it worth while
to secure her good-will by fulfilling one of her most urgent requests.
Nothing was nearer to her heart than the liberation of Jars, who had
been thrown into the Bastille on her account. She made requests in
his behalf through the diplomatic agent who attended to her especial
business at the French court: she spoke to the French ambassador in
London on the subject, and wrote to the Cardinal about it. Richelieu
granted her request. One day in May 1638 Chavigny, one of the ministers
employed under Richelieu, went to the Bastille and brought out Jars,
in the first instance to the dwelling of the Queen’s agent, to whom he
said that, at the command of the Cardinal, he delivered Jars into his
hands; henceforth he was the prisoner no longer of the King of France,
but of the Queen of England, and she might deal with him according to
her pleasure<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. It would have been impossible to fulfil the wish of
the Queen so as to confer a greater obligation on her. The way seemed
opened for establishing the best personal understanding between the
two courts and the two kingdoms, as it had already for some time been
opened for establishing a cordial understanding politically by the plan
of an alliance already referred to.</p>

<p>But meanwhile even in the personal relations between them a strong
counteracting influence came into play.</p>

<p>As early as the autumn of 1637 intelligence had reached the French
court that Mary de’ Medici, the mother of the King, weary of her
residence at Brussels, which led to no result in her favour, wished now
to visit England. The French ministers thought the matter important
enough for them to call the attention of the King of England to the
untoward consequences that might arise from it. They said to him that
the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1637.</span> world knew that the Queen-mother
cherished views favourable to Spain: that if she found a reception at
the court of the King of England, people would conclude that the latter
was not seriously in earnest about the alliance with France. They added
that Charles I would not be able any more than others to succeed in
reconciling mother and son; if for no other reason, because Louis XIII
had declined the mediation of his brother and of his brother-in-law the
Duke of Savoy, and regarded the matter as exclusively his own affair;
and moreover because he was convinced that the Queen-mother, if she
returned, would, with her friends and adherents, only give trouble<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>In England this expression of opinion awakened some displeasure.
Charles I expressed himself surprised that any one should think that
the Queen-mother could acquire so much influence over him as to shake
him in his inclination in favour of France. He said that she doubtless
did not even desire this: that he himself would not entertain the
thought of mediating, were he not certain that the Queen-mother was
resolved to think no more of what had occurred, and to throw herself
unreservedly into the arms of her son through the mediation of the
Cardinal<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>It appears to have been the fact that the Queen-mother had decided
to go to England mainly in order to take advantage of the friendly
relations established between the two courts, and so to effect her
return by means of the influence exerted by the one upon the other.
But in France people regarded her project only as a design suggested
by the Spaniards. As it had become clear to the latter that the
Queen-mother could render them no kind of assistance so long as she
lived away from France, the French thought that the Spaniards were
desirous of procuring her return to France in order to avail themselves
of her services; but that the French government could not allow itself
to be so grossly deceived; that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> it was as
important to the Queen-mother as she affirmed to detach herself from
the influence of the Spaniards, she had better return to her native
place, where she might expect ample maintenance to be given her by the
King her son.</p>

<p>At first the matter rested here. But Madame de Chevreuse coming from
Spain made her appearance at the English court, long before the Queen
moreover, early in 1638. As a great lady and a friend of the Queen
she met with a very honourable reception, in which no expense was
spared: the charges borne by the King every month of her stay were
reckoned at a considerable sum<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. To her old admirers, among whom
Earl Holland was the greatest, new ones were added: every one sought
her company; and she produced a fresh and cheerful excitement in the
naturally grave court. This however did not prevent her from showing
herself a strict Catholic in other respects, as we perceive from an
attempt she made to convert Lord Holland. She inspired the Queen with
the fatal thought of favouring Catholic tendencies in the education
of her children: all her wishes and manœuvres were directed to the
removal of the hindrances, which seemed to obstruct a close alliance
between the English and Spanish courts: she made proposals for an
union between the Princess Royal of England, who was still extremely
young, and an Infant of Spain, without regarding the objections
advanced against it on the ground of the experience of former times,
which she jestingly set aside. She had paid especial attention to the
Spanish ambassador Cardenas: the Papal envoy, Cuneo, relates that on
one occasion she even borrowed his carriage from him in order to visit
that ambassador without exciting remark<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. Charles I had been angry
with Cardenas on account of one of the ambassador’s reports which had
come to his knowledge; Madame de Chevreuse succeeded in removing the
misunderstanding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> and in restoring friendly
personal relations between them, which opened the door to further
negotiations.</p>

<p>If Richelieu was inclined at that time to allow Madame de Chevreuse to
return to France, and to promise her an entire indemnity for the past,
his inclination may have been due to the material hindrances thrown
in his way by her activity at a foreign court. That she was ever in
earnest about the negotiations for her return may be doubted.</p>

<p>In October 1638 Mary de’ Medici found means to set out for England from
Holland, where, out of regard for Richelieu, her residence was not
altogether viewed with favour. It was only when she put to sea that
she sent to announce her approach, adding however that she would turn
back again if she were likely to cause embarrassment to her children.
Queen Henrietta Maria in reality feared that the maternal authority
would place restrictions on her freedom: but it also gave her great
pleasure to see her mother again after so long a separation, and to
show her hospitality in her exile; her husband also would not now offer
any opposition, although the restless activity of the people who came
with the Queen was distasteful to him<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. The Queen-mother, who had
a rough passage of seven days, was received with all the honour due to
her rank and to the ties of relationship. Even in England she exhibited
the self-respect which she maintained during her misfortunes. When the
Privy Council paid her a visit, she did not even rise from her seat:
the King was seen to speak to her only with head uncovered, although
she was maintained by his kindness, which cost him no small sacrifice;
the Queen took pleasure in the performance of filial duties. Mary de’
Medici also had a Spanish match in view: she is said even to have
opened a negotiation for that object of her own accord, without being
authorised by her son-in-law. Above all she clung to her purpose of
using her residence in England to effect her return to France.</p>

<p>One day in December the French ambassador Bellièvre had had business at
the royal palace. He was desirous of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> leaving,
when he was detained by Lord Holland in one of the galleries, and
after a short time the King and Queen of England with the Queen-mother
came in through the very door by which he would have been obliged to
withdraw. He had intentionally avoided paying her his respects, as
all the other ambassadors had done: when she came nearer she now said
to him that she had a word for his ear, and the King and Queen left
her alone with him. She then assured him that, after so many painful
experiences, she was of quite another mind from that in which she had
formerly been when she left France: that she conjured the Cardinal to
deliver her out of her misery, and not to leave her under the necessity
of begging her bread: that she wished for nothing except to be near
her son, and that she promised if near him to interfere in nothing:
but that if this indulgence could not be obtained for the present, she
wished to be allowed to remain anywhere else in France, and have a
maintenance given her; that she would remove from the neighbourhood of
her person all who were displeasing to the Cardinal, and would in all
things do what he advised her<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. Bellièvre in vain declared that his
commission did not go so far as to allow him to listen to her; that he
was merely ambassador at the court of the King of England. She replied
that she knew that the French ambassadors were bound to report what was
said to them, and that this was enough for her.</p>

<p>Cardinal Richelieu however had made up his mind never to allow her
to return to France, and to give her a maintenance only if she would
repair to Florence. There was no question of compassion with him.</p>

<p>The Queen of England remembered full well that her brother had
forbidden her to interfere in any way in the affairs of the
Queen-mother: but the unhappy plight of her mother, the general
interest which she awakened at court, and her own confidence in
herself, founded upon the respect which the power of her husband must
procure for her, moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1638.</span> her notwithstanding to
make an attempt to do something for her mother. After some time, as
her first expression of opinion had no kind of effect, she sent one
of her people, Henry Jermyn, who of them all perhaps stood highest in
her confidence, to the French court in order to set on foot in France
itself a negotiation for the Queen-mother’s return.</p>

<p>Bellièvre not only did not recommend the Queen’s proposals, but was
even adverse to them.</p>

<p>There are everywhere petty motives of animosity which not seldom
exercise an influence upon affairs: and here also this appears to have
been the case. Bellièvre, a small but well-shaped man, still young, and
of lively aspiring spirit, had special reasons for dissatisfaction. He
was a member of a French family that belonged to the nobility of the
long robe, and it was his ambition never to stand in the position of
an inferior. He was annoyed that the honour of the tabouret, i.e. the
privilege of being allowed to sit in the presence of the Queen, had
not been conferred on his wife, although it had been conceded without
hesitation to the Duchess of Chevreuse. The efforts and intrigues of
this lady were therefore all the more obnoxious to him. He believed
that she brought the King offers from the Spaniards which ran counter
to those of the French: he pretended to know that she expressed her
undisguised joy at losses which had overtaken the French in the field.
On the whole it appeared to him that, under her influence and that
of the Queen-mother, Queen Henrietta Maria herself had contracted an
inclination for the policy of Spain, from which she had hitherto been
free, and which gained ground also among her suite; not perhaps with
Lord Holland, who continued true to French interests, but with the
rest, from whom for that very reason Lord Holland was beginning to
detach himself.</p>

<p>Bellièvre expressed his conviction that it would do no good to receive
back the Queen-mother into France: he thought that, if she were
replaced in exactly the same position which she had enjoyed before,
she yet would never part with her advisers. He was of opinion, even
with regard to the Queen of England, that it would not be of much
use to give ear to her proposals. Certainly if they were declined
the ministers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> of the Queen-mother would do
everything to sever England from France: but even if her proposals were
acceded to, the same men would for that very reason be so much the more
completely masters of the English court, and would enforce their wishes
on the Queen, and even on the King<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<p>In consequence of this Jermyn not only found no opening for his
proposals, but met with a bad reception generally. Queen Henrietta
Maria made a jest of it, but nevertheless she was irritated. Among
her friends she let it be known that she was treated in France as a
daughter of the house, that is, without any respect, and with the
contempt which had always been shown there towards England; but that
some day she would be able to take her revenge. Among her friends
Montague, who for love of her had become a Catholic, was regarded as
the one who principally confirmed her in her views.</p>

<p>How long had people in France already waited for the day when the Queen
of England would acquire influence over her husband! This came to pass
for the first time in the course of the disputes with the Scots, after
which a certain community of interest sprung up between the Episcopal
Church and the English Catholics, both of whom had to expect their
ruin from the rise of the Puritans. The Queen was useful to the King
from her influence with the Catholics: cases had arisen in which her
counsels had proved suited to the occasion: he began to listen to her.
But when this period arrived, the Queen was no longer on the side of
the French government. She felt affronted and rebuffed by the Cardinal:
she thought him capable of allying himself with the Scots against
England; and she espoused the cause of her mother with increasing
warmth. In March 1639 the French ambassador expresses to his court his
fears that the Queen of England, under the influence of the friends of
the Queen-mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> would do everything which
the latter might suggest to her against the interests of France. Many
other opponents of Cardinal Richelieu also happened to be in England at
that time;—Vieuville whom he had once overthrown, and De la Valette
who had retired from France because he had allowed himself to be
entangled in a plot against the Cardinal. Bellièvre reports that the
latter was almost every day in the company of Madame de Chevreuse; that
he had long conferences with the ministers of the Queen-mother, and
on those occasions also saw the English Queen; that they all were in
uninterrupted communication with the Spanish ambassador<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p>Already long before this time new projects of wide range had been
spoken of, which were said to have been set afloat in England by
means of the friends of the Queen-mother. At that time a Frenchman
named Petit, who possessed property in Lorraine, and was engaged in
chemical researches in London, paid a visit to the French ambassador,
and told him that they had embraced the design of hazarding an attack
upon Brittany: he said that they had selected a place (of which he did
not mention the name), which might be captured with little trouble,
and maintained without difficulty. Moreover people in France spoke
of an impending alteration in the government on the death of the
Cardinal, who was very weak and sickly. Vieuville said to the Duchess
of Chevreuse that she would be wrong if she did not take care to be on
the spot in France at the moment when such a change occurred. People
expected everything from the preference Queen Anne felt for her.</p>

<p>These hostile tendencies, which certainly were primarily of a personal
character, but which nevertheless penetrated deeply into politics, now
fell in with those differences in the conduct of political affairs
which allowed no hope of union.</p>

<p>However seriously Charles I on his part might affirm that he would
not estrange himself from France, yet Bellièvre nevertheless adhered
to the opinion that this was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> possible,
nay probable. He knew that the Queen, so far as could be seen, was an
enemy of France; that many members of the Privy Council were in the pay
of Spain and drew pensions from that power; that many others, who had
hitherto been prevented by regard for the Queen from speaking against
France, were now on the contrary invited to do so by her change of
feeling: and that nothing less could be expected than that even the
King would allow himself to be hurried into hostility to France.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances people in France were very far from
expecting King Charles to come into the French and Swedish alliance
in consequence of the Pacification of Berwick. On the contrary this
agreement seemed to constitute a danger, as it untied the hands of the
King of England. It cannot be doubted that alliances between the Scots
and Cardinal Richelieu had already been formed: they were carried on
through his almoner Chambres. They may have inspired the Scots with a
general feeling of courage, owing to the support which was held out
to them in consequence; but they could hardly have had much effect
upon the steps which they actually took, if only because the medium
of communication was a zealous Catholic. But now Bellièvre advised
his employers to espouse the cause of the Scots with a very definite
political aim. He considered that the old alliance between France and
Scotland ought to be renewed, and the King of England hindered from
ever embarking on hostilities against France without the fear arising
in his mind that he would have the Scots against him. Bellièvre thought
that the negotiations which were being carried on between Charles I and
the Scottish Parliament ought to be made use of and directed towards
the attainment of this object<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

the son of the Lord Treasurer, who at that time was entrusted with
an extraordinary mission in France, was impelled to intercept the
correspondence between Lord Holland and people in authority in France,
which on his return he laid unopened before the King. It turned out to
be quite innocent: but the King approved Weston’s conduct. The Queen’s
whole court however was thrown into a state of excitement. Holland
sent Weston a challenge to fight a duel; but the King succeeded in
preventing it. (Calendar 1633-34, ii. 14.)</p>

<span class="small">RELATIONS OF ENGLAND WITH THE ARMY OF BERNARD OF WEIMAR AND WITH THE
SPANISH FLEET UNDER OQUENDO.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It is quite true that Charles I was at this time engaged, as he had
been at an earlier period, in carrying on negotiations with the Spanish
court which might easily have led to an open quarrel with France.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1638 a contract was drawn up at Brussels, according
to which Spain and England were to unite in order to wrest from the
French their conquests in Germany and Italy; indeed it was the great
interest which the two crowns had in this object which brought them
together. On the other hand the Emperor Ferdinand III was to be induced
by the Spanish court to recall the ban which had been issued against
Frederick Count Palatine, and to restore the Electorship to the heirs
of that prince. King Charles was quite ready to accede to the contract,
if only trustworthy security were given to him with regard to the
Palatinate<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1639 accordingly the intention of Charles I to take
troops from the Spanish Netherlands into his service, as formerly
mentioned, was much discussed. The Cardinal-Infant asked a question on
the subject in Spain.</p>

<p>A third point on which negotiations took place was still more urgent.
The Spanish monarchy was once more collecting all its resources to send
a great fleet with troops and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> necessaries
of war to the Netherlands. The Spaniards indeed boasted that they
desired to chastise the insolence of the Dutch and French: but in
fact they were conscious of the superiority of their adversaries.
They sought to assure themselves beforehand, if not of the alliance
of the English, yet at least of their protection within English
waters, if disaster or too strong a resistance should drive their
fleet thither. Charles I did not refuse this request, always provided
that satisfaction should be done to him in return in the affair
of the Palatinate, with regard to which the Spaniards made fresh
proposals<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.</p>

<p>What injustice is done to Charles I by any one who accuses him of
having negligently lost sight of the cause of his nephews! It is true
that he would not draw the sword in their behalf: but they supplied
the principal motive which guided him in his diplomatic transactions.
His relations with the great parties and powers who were fighting for
ascendancy on the Continent, were principally determined by regard for
them: the ceaseless vacillation of his policy was due to nothing but
the multiplicity of the circumstances which affected them.</p>

<p>It certainly seemed that he might expect the Spaniards to do most
for them; for Spain, by its influence on Austria, could act most
effectually in support of the restoration of the Elector Palatine.
But we know how often he had been deceived in this hope: the relation
between German Austria and Bavaria especially made the designs
suggested by the Spanish ambassador impracticable. Had the King been
willing to give his unreserved support to the interests of Spain, which
were so closely connected with those of Catholicism, he would never
have effected anything. He therefore sought an alliance with the French
court: the affair of the Palatinate formed the principal subject of the
stipulations he made with it. But Charles I could not and dared not
side unconditionally even with France: for by taking this step he would
have been compelled to come to an open breach with Spain, which would
have disturbed the profitable traffic of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span>
English nation with the distant possessions of that monarchy: and he
would thereby have promoted the general ascendancy of France, which
was in the highest degree disadvantageous to the position of England.
Moreover he would not even have reached his end by this path, for the
final decision still rested with the Emperor.</p>

<p>In these embarrassments it was the policy of King Charles to
make advances to those powers which were striving to resist the
Austro-Spanish house, while he did not exactly make common cause with
them: he hoped, as it seems, to make such use of the fluctuations of
fortune and of war as to induce the Emperor himself at last, for the
sake of his own interest, to grant the wished-for indulgence.</p>

<p>The affair of the Palatinate forms as it were the woof in the web of
Charles I’s history, running through it in all directions. And never at
any time had it been of more importance. In one of the most remarkable
entanglements of European relations, the considerations arising out of
it decided his line of policy.</p>

<p>The conquest of Breisach by Duke Bernard of Weimar in December 1638
was hailed with as much joy in England as in every other Protestant
country. The establishment of this brave general on the great
continental line of communication between the different parts of the
Spanish monarchy, could not but determine that power to devise some
way out of the difficulty. The occupation of this place too threatened
Bavaria with an immediate danger, which could not fail to make an
impression on the Elector Maximilian, on whom everything depended.
A project was even entertained of marrying the victorious Duke of
Saxe-Weimar to a princess of the Palatinate, so as to attach him as
closely as possible to the interest of that family. Duke Bernard for
his own part sought to make himself a little more independent of
France: not that he had in view the foundation of a third party, which
would have brought everything into confusion; he was only unwilling
to be a vassal of France: he thought of taking his place beside that
power as an independent ally. In this enterprise he had Protestant
Switzerland on his side, which was very unwilling to see the French
establish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> themselves in Lorraine. This
design moreover exactly suited the policy of Charles I, to whom the
aggrandisement of France was displeasing.</p>

<p>The unexpected death of Duke Bernard in July 1639, whilst he was
preparing to assume so great a position, must be regarded as a general
calamity. At first however it seemed as if this casualty would even
have consequences favourable to the plans of England and the Palatine
house. Many Englishmen had already made preparations for taking
service in Bernard’s army: the project was now mooted of putting the
Elector Palatine at its head, by which means he would at once have
regained the position of a military power. Charles Louis seized this
idea with ardour. While he opened negotiations on the subject at the
court of Sweden through his ambassador, he came himself to England
in order to gain for his enterprise the support of the King. The
ambassador accredited by Switzerland, who had just arrived in England,
displayed especial zeal: he tried every expedient to move the Cantons
to action in the Elector’s behalf. Letters were instantly written to
the directors of the army, who at once returned an answer. They showed
themselves quite ready to accept the Elector as commander-in-chief,
when he should appear amongst them, but on condition that the King of
England paid them a definite subsidy monthly, in order to maintain
the efficiency of the troops and keep them in good spirits. In spite
of the want of money, which had been rendered doubly pressing by the
Scottish campaign, we learn that the sum required for taking over the
command of the army was nevertheless got together, and hopes were
held out of further advances. A private individual, Lord Craven, who
had most abundant means at his command, and had formed the resolution
of applying them to the service of the Palatine family, was ready to
attend the Elector to Germany<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<p>This enterprise corresponded exactly with the views of the King. He
hoped to achieve his great end by cleverly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span>
availing himself of a favourable moment, while at the same time he made
no great efforts, and did not actually participate in the war itself,
or come to a breach with Spain, with which on the contrary he carried
on constant negotiations. If he had succeeded in his design, he would
have attained to a different position in foreign, and perhaps even in
domestic, affairs.</p>

<p>A difficulty however stood in his way, which might be regarded as
insuperable: namely, the opposition to be expected on the side of
France.</p>

<p>The court of France had hitherto regarded the army of Bernard of Weimar
as half its own, inasmuch as the Duke owed the means of keeping it
together in a great measure to French subsidies: how then could it be
even imagined that France was to stand by quietly when this army not
merely claimed to act for itself, but even made itself dependent on
another power? Cardinal Richelieu on the contrary intended to acquire
both the army itself, and its conquests, permanently for France. This
was what he had most at heart: he was nearer to the scene of action; he
had long formed relations with its leaders; he was better provided with
money: how could he fail to anticipate and nullify the negotiations of
England?</p>

<p>This obstacle to his plans did not escape the notice of King Charles:
but owing to the peculiar complication of circumstances he expected to
get into his hands a means of removing it by a counter-concession.</p>

<p>Just at that time, in the middle of September, 1639, the Spanish fleet
appeared at sea. Long as it had been prepared beforehand, it was
not at starting sure of success, and reckoned on the protection of
England. King Charles had been entreated, as we have seen, to grant
it hospitable reception in English harbours, if matters so turned out
as to make this necessary. And straightway this contingency occurred.
The fleet on this occasion, as before, consisted principally of huge
galleons, whose tackling was too weak long to resist wind and tide
in those narrow seas: nor was the fleet adequately provided with
artillery and seamen. On the first collision with a much smaller Dutch
squadron, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> cruising in the Channel
under Van Tromp, the Spanish admiral Oquendo found himself compelled
to seek a refuge on the English coast in the Downs near Dover. And as
his preservation from a superior enemy now depended on the protection
which Charles I would accord him there, the admiral entreated it most
urgently, saying that the honour of the Spanish monarchy and the
maintenance of its dominion in the Netherlands were dependent on the
King. Charles I appeared strongly inclined to grant his prayer. He
opened a negotiation with the ambassador Cardenas, in which the affair
of the Palatinate was brought forward afresh: and Cardenas promised him
all possible compliance and assistance in the matter.</p>

<p>The Dutch and French ambassadors, however, urged an opposite course on
the King. They called his attention to the fact that he stood in close
relations with their governments as well as with Sweden, and had all
but concluded a treaty with them: they suggested to him that he ought
not to incur their hostility by preventing them from annihilating the
Spaniards here on his coasts; that he ought to remember that he had
never hitherto experienced any benefit at the hands of the Spaniards,
and that even on the present occasion he could not hope that they would
fulfil their promises.</p>

<p>This was one of the most important moments in the life of Charles I.
The two great conflicting forces which divided the world, and with each
of which he had some connexion, now called upon him to choose between
them without delay. This was even a source of moral embarrassment,
inasmuch as the King by his previous attitude had given both parties a
certain right to expect his support: but the political embarrassment
was the most conspicuous, and seems to have been the only one felt by
the King. He had now to put an end to all wavering, and in one decisive
instant to throw himself on the side of one of the two parties.</p>

<p>Bellièvre once more brought into play the whole of the influence which
he claimed to exercise on Queen Henrietta Maria as the ambassador of
her family. He reports that she had favoured an adverse policy, but
that he had spoken with her in a manner which might certainly have
provoked her displeasure, but which however had in fact changed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> opinion. Negotiations were opened between the
ambassador and the King himself through the mediation of the Queen.</p>

<p>But if the promises which the Spaniards gave with regard to the affair
of the Palatinate supplied a motive for extending shelter to them,
how much stronger a motive, under the circumstances which we have
mentioned, must the King have had for attempting to win over the French
government!</p>

<p>Bellièvre, when informed of the negotiations that were being carried
on with Spain, acted on the hint that France must oppose promises on
her own part to those made by Spain, and at last asked to be informed
what was expected of him. We learn nothing of the deliberations
that may then have been carried on between the King and Queen. But
the preference was given to the plan of purchasing support for the
Elector Palatine, in the projects that were being agitated, by making
concessions to France. In answer to the French ambassador, the Queen
expressed a hope of obtaining a promise from him that the Elector
Palatine should be placed at the head of the army of Bernard of
Weimar. She added that in this event the King on his part would offer
no resistance to the wishes of the French: that he would not break
with the Spaniards it is true, but that he would not interfere with
any steps which the Dutch might take against the Spanish fleet<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.
Bellièvre said that he was not commissioned to make proposals; still he
by no means set aside those which had been submitted to him: he merely
asked how many troops the King was willing to give the Elector to take
with him to Germany. Charles I replied that he rather left the King of
France to support the Elector with troops; that he could do no more in
this way than have some 6000 men enlisted in England and transported to
the coast of France, where he intended that they should be taken into
the pay of the French: that in return for this however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1639.</span> and especially for that other far greater service of
allowing the Spanish fleet to be destroyed on his coasts, he required
the King of France to promise that he would conclude neither truce
nor peace which did not comprise the restitution of the Palatinate.
This was the same object which he had already attempted to gain in the
former negotiations: open hostilities against Spain had been demanded
of him in return. His intention was to extract the desired engagement
from France, without committing himself to this extent, by means of the
concessions which he now expressed his readiness to make. He allowed
the ambassador fourteen days for procuring the consent of his court: if
this period expired without any result, he intended to be at liberty to
make terms with Spain.</p>

<p>It is indeed possible that King Charles was incensed afresh against
Spain by the tidings, which he then received, of a renewal of the
connexion between the Spaniards and the malcontents in Ireland; and
that he called to mind their former breaches of faith. He had also
certainly not given them any definite promise of protection. Still it
remains a most odious imputation on the sovereign who laid claim to
maritime supremacy that he resolved to deliver over the weaker party,
who had come to his coast entreating shelter, into the hands of the
stronger in return for an advantage which he bargained to obtain from
them. What seduced him was the consideration that he need not interfere
decisively: he thought that, without breaking with the Spaniards, he
could bind their adversaries to him, and carry off the fruits of the
victory without drawing the sword himself. And moreover this was after
all but a project, not a settled conclusion. Meanwhile he continued his
negotiations with the Spaniards, from whom he claimed a large sum of
money in return for the armament which he had been forced to equip for
their protection.</p>

<p>But how could these counsels have had any good result, inspired as
they were by weakness and the love of peace on the one side, and on
the other by the intention of turning an accidental combination of
circumstances to the greatest possible advantage?</p>

<p>The French felt the advantage of the position of general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1639.</span> superiority in which they found themselves placed. Even
under existing circumstances they did not feel in any mood to accede to
these proposals of Charles I. They adhered to their wish that he should
at last sign the offensive and defensive alliance, which had been so
long talked of, and which was still kept in prospect. If he would then
support his nephew the Elector Palatine with an army, which he would
be expected always to keep in an effective condition, and if he would
further himself contribute to the actual destruction of the Spanish
fleet, they thought that he might feel assured that France would
conclude no arrangement without stipulating for the restitution of the
Palatinate, and procuring satisfaction for the Elector. The French
court passed over in silence the proposal for helping the Elector
to become commander-in-chief of the army of Bernard of Weimar: it
thought it best not to express any opinion at all upon that subject. It
certainly expected no result from the renewal of former demands; but it
was already satisfied with the maintenance of the negotiations: above
all it wished Bellièvre to take care that King Charles did not come to
an agreement with the Spaniards, as the Dutch fleet would meanwhile
gain time to annihilate the Spanish<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

<p>The interval which Charles I had allowed for the answer of the French
court had not yet expired: he was still able to think that he had the
matter in his own hands, when the Dutch admiral Van Tromp, empowered
by a resolution of the States-General to that effect, proceeded to
attack the Spanish fleet in the English roads. The English vice-admiral
Pennington was neither strong enough to prevent the conflict, nor had
he any orders to do so. The Dutch sank a number of Spanish ships,
and burned others: the number of those which they captured was about
eleven<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>: the greater part, however, with Oquendo himself on board,
favoured by a thick fog, escaped to the opposite coast and ran into
Dunkirk harbour.</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet was not, strictly speaking, annihilated;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1639.</span> the booty which the Dutch carried off hardly equalled the
outlay which their armament had cost them. The event must however be
regarded as decisive. A similar fleet never again set sail from Spain
for the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Charles I, in allowing this transaction, had rendered a great service
to the Protestant cause; but at the same time he had played an
uncertain part unworthy of his great position, from which none but
consequences disadvantageous to him could arise.</p>

<p>The suspicion entertained against him by his subjects went so far that
they even inferred from his dubious attitude a secret understanding,
to the prejudice of their religion, between him and the Spaniards.
They hailed the occurrence as a victory over the King himself. True
Englishmen felt annoyed that a great battle had been fought out on
their coasts without their participation.</p>

<p>The Spanish ambassador complained loudly and bitterly. Charles
I answered him with contemptuous remarks on the slight power of
resistance displayed by the Spanish Armada. The Dutch ambassador,
on the other hand, who attempted to excuse the enterprise of his
countrymen, was rebuffed by the King with harsh expressions.
Disagreeable incidents encountered him on every side.</p>

<p>But the most annoying of the quarrels in which he was involved arose
out of his design upon the army of Bernard of Weimar, which he
attempted to carry out even before the defeat of the Spanish fleet.
He did not even wait for the French court to state its views in reply
to his application. As soon as a favourable answer arrived from the
Directors of that army he allowed the Elector, Charles Louis, to set
out without delay to take possession of the command.</p>

<p>And indeed the intention was that the Elector, attended by only
a few trusty companions, should take the route through France to
Breisach, which was both the nearest way, and was least exposed to the
disturbances of war. The King said to the French ambassador, that the
Elector should make his appearance with the army merely as a volunteer;
and that any further steps should be dependent on the answer of the
French court, which was still looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> for. The
ambassador called his attention to the impropriety of a prince of such
high rank travelling through France without previously giving notice
to the King, in fact without even so much as a safe conduct from him.
But Charles I would hear of no delay: he professed to think that his
ambassador, the Earl of Leicester, would still have time enough to make
a communication to the French court on the subject. Bellièvre, however,
did not himself believe that the King was serious in his professions.
In his report he says, that such a communication, if made, would be
made only after the event; that the intention was that the Prince
should travel through France incognito, without seeing the King, or any
of his ministers. In reality, people in England thought that if he went
to Court, he would be detained there until matters had been settled
in the army to his disadvantage: that if on the contrary he made his
appearance at the right moment, and, what was more, with sufficient
supplies of money, the greater part of the officers would declare
in his favour. And it appeared quite possible to go through France
unrecognised, as the King himself had succeeded in doing in his youth.</p>

<p>Thus it fell out that Charles I allowed his nephew to set off for
France, with few attendants, but provided with money and good letters
of credit. On October 15 Charles Louis left England on board one of
those ships which were still lying beside the Spanish fleet in the
Downs. On his arrival at Boulogne he was saluted by all the other
ships. On October 17 he was at St. Denys, and on the following day he
proceeded through the capital to Villejuif on the road to Lyons. He
endeavoured to maintain so strict an incognito, that he did not even
see the English ambassador, for he wished to allow no one at all to
recognise him<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the French government was kept informed of every step
which he took. It knew that the object of his journey was in complete
contradiction to its own intentions; and it was not accustomed in
political affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> to show the smallest regard
to others. When the Elector arrived at Moulins he was detained for
want of a safe conduct; and was brought without further ceremony to
the fortress of Vincennes, where his captors professed their intention
of examining him. The French government maintained that it was thereby
exercising its right: for if the intentions of this Prince were good
and laudable, why should he so carefully conceal his journey through
France? But so far as his intentions were not of this character, but
were hostile to the interests of the King of France, they alleged that
they had every reason for not allowing him to travel any further<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>Just at that time the convention was concluded by which the army of
Bernard passed into the service of France. On October 22 Erlach, who
had the principal direction of the army, took the oath in the presence
of Guébriant. All counter action to which the feeling of other officers
might have given rise, if the Elector had been present in person, was
avoided beforehand by his imprisonment at Vincennes. His presumed
secrecy was what furnished a specious pretext for making him harmless.</p>

<p>The King of England regarded this transaction not merely as a
misfortune, but as an affront. The services which he had rendered
to the French were returned with ingratitude, or, rather, with the
contrary of that recompense which he had expected from them. But, while
he made known his displeasure on the subject, twice as great a feeling
of irritation set in on the side of the French. They had the less
hesitation in taking part against Charles I wherever an opportunity of
doing so presented itself.</p>

<span class="small">RENEWED DISTURBANCES IN SCOTLAND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The French nowhere found wider scope for this policy than in Scotland,
where the Pacification of Berwick had not only not led to peace, but
had stirred up yet more violent dissensions.</p>

<p>From the first moment different opinions were formed among the Scots
with regard to this measure. Even among the Covenanters there were many
who hailed it with delight. For what, they asked, must have happened
if the King had continued obstinate, and they had been obliged to
fight against him? Among the English, at all events, they did not find
so much support as had been expected; even among the Scots the old
divisions were reviving; many of the Covenanters felt their consciences
smite them when they thought that they would be plunged into a bloody
conflict with their King. But on the other hand it was remarked by
others that the literal meaning of the conditions did not offer them
any adequate security. They saw the camp broken up with feelings of
dissatisfaction: for they thought that without such an army they would
be obliged to submit to every dictate of the King. They complained that
the agreement had been concerted in far too great haste by some few,
without the concurrence of a sufficient number of nobility, gentry, and
clergy.</p>

<p>Even at the moment when the Pacification was being concluded, these
differences had made their appearance. The King had expressed himself
in conciliatory and soothing terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> about some
clauses which gave offence by their severity<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. These expressions
were taken down, and passed from hand to hand: at the same time it
was thought expedient to append to the King’s proclamation, which was
made known in the camp, a remark upon the sense in which it was to be
understood. People would have been glad to have procured a further
written declaration to this effect from the King himself; but he would
not allow himself to be persuaded to give this, just as he persevered
in maintaining a somewhat proud and rigid attitude in general. Men like
Argyle, when they appeared in the royal camp, could not congratulate
themselves on meeting with a particularly gracious reception. Between
the nobles who attached themselves to the King, and those who belonged
to the other party, unpleasant discussions broke out in the King’s
presence. The Covenanters were discontented and full of suspicion when
they saw the sovereign to whom they wished to restore a certain, even
if not the old traditional, measure of power, surrounded by men of high
temporal and spiritual rank, whom they regarded as their enemies.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the people also were thrown into a state of excitement,
mainly because the strongholds wrested from the King’s garrisons
were again to be restored to them. In Edinburgh especially it was
thought insupportable that the Castle of that town should again
receive a garrison such as had formerly held it, and, what was more,
with Ruthven for its commander, a man who, as well as others, had
fought in the German wars, but was known to be a decided Royalist.
Popular disturbances broke out, in which the King’s servants were
insulted,—Hamilton especially, who had hastened thither in order
to enforce in person the conditions of peace, which, for the most
part, had been suggested by him. A number of the Scottish nobility,
whom the King had ordered to come to his camp with a view to further
negotiations were prevented by force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> from going
thither. It is probable that they were not sorry for this, even if it
cannot be proved that they had themselves provoked it.</p>

<p>When the King promised to attend both the Assemblies in Scotland in
person, he cherished the hope of reviving his power, to some extent,
during the proceedings, and by means of them and of preserving the old
forms of the constitution intact in their most important particulars.
Hamilton now came back from Edinburgh with the impression that this
was impossible, and that the King could expect nothing there but fresh
losses. A full month had not yet elapsed from the conclusion of the
Pacification; yet he already declared a fresh war to be inevitable. In
making representations on this point, he raised a number of questions
that had a wide application: for instance—whether the King could
procure money for such a war without an English parliament? and if not,
whether he was willing to summon a parliament, and to leave himself
to its discretion<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>? No one decided these questions; but all had
made up their minds to witness further complications, when the King
unexpectedly announced his resolution to return to London. The two
Assemblies were not on that account given up; they could not but take
place; but they appear only as attempts at a further pacification, the
results of which were to decide whether after all recourse must be had
once more to arms. Hamilton declined to appear at them as the King’s
Commissioner. The Earl of Traquair, whose views at that time more
nearly approached those of the Scots, undertook this office. On August
12th the General Assembly was opened at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>According to the terms of the Pacification the Scots refrained from
demanding a formal ratification of the resolutions of the Assembly
of Glasgow. But as to the substance of them, they declared to the
Commissioner that they would cling to it as long as the breath of life
remained in their bodies. They would not recede a hair’s-breadth from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> assertion that the ground on which they
stood was the only legal ground. In open opposition to the King’s
opinion, they again enacted that the proceedings of the last Assemblies
of the Church which had been held under his father were null and void:
if the King would at any rate, under present circumstances, allow a
new Assembly to be convened within a year’s time, they on their part
were ready to make a permanent statute, prescribing that the Assembly
should be held once every year, and if necessary still oftener. The
Commissioner on his part could not refuse to permit the abolition
of Episcopacy: this was the principal concession made by the King:
a dispute however arose about the wording of the resolution, which
concerned indeed only one expression, but at the same time affected the
main point of the controversy. The King had consented to the measure,
on the ground that Episcopacy was contrary to the constitution of the
Church of Scotland; the Assembly laid down that it was absolutely
unlawful. At last Traquair assented to this expression, but the King
showed great indignation, for he thought that what was contrary to
the constitution of some one church was not therefore absolutely
unlawful<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>: and he was afraid that the expression, if not moderated
by a limitation to Scotland, might be applied to the English Church,
which, like the Scottish, was a reformed Church. He censured the
Commissioner in harsh terms for his compliance.</p>

<p>Still greater and more immediately urgent differences were to be
anticipated, when on August 31 the Parliament met, like the Assembly,
in Edinburgh. The summons had been issued under the presumption of
the continuance of the legal forms; but now the King himself had
given up the bishops; and the first question was, how the vacancies
in the Parliament were to be filled. The King thought of replacing
the bishops by clergymen selected by himself; but the Scots were of
opinion that in this way Episcopacy would be abolished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1639.</span> only in name, while in substance it was retained; and the
nobles did not wish the influence which the bishops had exercised upon
the nomination of the Lords of Articles, and upon the deliberations
of Parliament, to be revived. Even the Scottish clergy felt no desire
for this dignity, to which in fact they traced all the abuses that had
crept in; they at that time declared that the participation of the
clergy in civil business was as unlawful as Episcopacy itself<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.
It was vainly objected on the other hand, that in this way one of
the three estates was abolished, which was a criminal proceeding
forbidden under the penalties attaching to high treason. The Scots
affirmed that the concessions of the King carried with them at the
same time the removal of the episcopal element and the necessity of
constituting a parliament of a new kind. They now themselves took in
hand the work of reconstitution without delay; for, as they alleged,
the King had promised them a free parliament. In fact their design was
to give the representatives of the shires an independent position,
almost as in the English Parliament; they did not wish to abolish
the Lords of Articles, but to draw them from the deputies of the
nobility, gentry, and commonalty, as was then forthwith done<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>:
it is quite clear that this was not merely a question of form, but
also a question of the distribution of power. For by the nomination
of other clergy in place of the bishops, the crown would certainly
have been able to win back its former influence over the Parliament,
and the gentry would have lost the authority which they had derived
from their participation in the movements of the Covenanters. But
how should the members of the Tables and of the Committees, who had
acquired a feeling of independence, have again returned to their
former position? They endeavoured, on the contrary, to maintain, even
under parliamentary forms, the power which they had acquired, and they
succeeded in their endeavour. Not only was the Parliament transformed
according to their views, but the most important rights were claimed
for it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> Parliament proposed that the
King’s Privy Council should be responsible to it, and that the King
should be bound to follow its advice in making appointments to high
military commands, especially in the fortified places; and to comply
with its recommendation in alterations of the coinage: even the right
of conferring honours and dignities was in future to be exercised
only under definite conditions; the Treasury was no longer to possess
any jurisdiction. When we consider the scope of these proposals, we
understand why the royal commissioner brought his whole power to bear,
by whatever means he could, to prevent the Parliament from advancing to
definitive resolutions in the direction on which they had entered. He
adjourned Parliament, at first for a short time. This was repeated some
eight times in succession: at last he pronounced it to be prorogued
from November 1639 until June 1640. This step however raised a question
which was as important as any of those which he was attempting to
get rid of. The Kings of England and Scotland had hitherto exercised
the right of dissolving as well as of convoking Parliament: to other
sovereigns who did not possess this right in dealing with their
representative assemblies, this had appeared to be a most enviable
prerogative. The Scottish Parliament now denied this right; it sought
to show that the right belonged to the King and his commissioner
only in concert with Parliament. The Assembly broke up, it is true,
but it left a committee behind it, which claimed to be considered as
representing the Parliament, and transacted public business in this
capacity.</p>

<p>How completely contrary to the expectations which had been entertained
at Berwick was the course which affairs had now taken! We do not join
the complaints of treachery and breach of faith which were raised
by men of the different parties against one another. Two powers and
forces, between which a reconciliation was hardly possible any longer,
now stood in opposition to one another. The monarchy on the one side,
which, in spite of the great concessions which it made, nevertheless
maintained its pretension to possess lawfully within itself plenary
public authority; and, on the other, a parliamentary and spiritual
power which had grown up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> during the rising
under the patronage of proud nobles and preachers mighty in the word,
and which would not at any price resign the independence which it had
once asserted. The attempt which the two parties had made at Berwick to
approach one another brought to light the internal opposition between
them. The Scots, proceeding onwards with the logical consistency
which from the first moment had marked their course, achieved such a
measure of independence in determining the internal arrangements of
the State in spiritual and temporal matters, that the monarchy was
reduced to a mere name. They thought that they were thus defending an
universal interest at the same time. Whoever reads the journals and
memoirs of the Scots sees clearly for the first time how entirely they
identified their cause at home with that of Protestantism, and with
the Continental struggle against the Austro-Spanish power. They note
the advance of the Swedes, of the German powers allied with them, and
of the Dutch and French as an advantage to themselves. The advance of
Baner into Bohemia in the summer of 1639, when he even made Vienna
tremble; the further advance of the army of Bernard of Weimar, even
after the death of its leader, and the danger with which it threatened
Mainz, while in Westphalia and in Franconia the friends of the Emperor
were kept down, and his enemies raised their heads:—all these events
appeared to them to indicate the general victory of Protestantism,
which indeed was their own victory also<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. They were above all
pleased that the Spanish fleet should be blockaded, and at last
defeated on the English coast; for the embarrassment into which King
Charles was thrown contributed to their security.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, had they not, besides the support which they
found in the relations between the great Powers of the world, also
received some special assurances from one side or the other?</p>

<p>The French ambassador, Bellièvre, felt no hesitation in putting
himself in alliance with the adversaries of King Charles in Scotland,
in systematic opposition to the tendencies prevailing at the English
court, which he regarded as dangerous to the interests of France. He
was not, strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> speaking, authorised by his
court to take this step. Yet he acted in the name of his court when
he assisted a few Scots of the Covenanting party, with whom he had
become acquainted in London, to go to Edinburgh, in order to further
his designs among the members of the Assemblies in that city. He
wished them to keep three objects before their eyes—the maintenance
of the privileges of the Scots if the Pacification was brought to
a final conclusion<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>; the renewal of the old alliance between
France and Scotland; and lastly, a representation of the Scots in the
English Privy Council. It is not to be supposed that the emissaries
of Bellièvre exercised much direct influence upon the course of the
transactions of the General Assembly or of the Parliament, for these
bodies observed in their movements an internal consistency of their
own; but no one will venture to deny that the leaders were encouraged
to persevere in their course, even at the risk of breaking with their
King, by the thought that in case of extremities they might reckon
upon the support of France. Under these circumstances the maintenance
of this alliance promoted their own security. As early as August 1639,
Argyle, Lesley, and Rothes, addressed a letter to Bellièvre, in which
they alleged circumstances as an excuse for the delay of the French
enlistments in Scotland, about which Bellièvre had intentionally
complained in terms intimating suspicion, though deeper than he himself
felt, while at the same time, he referred to the old alliances between
France and Scotland, which he said ought ‘not to be disturbed by any
shadow of mistrust<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. Towards the end of the year, King Charles
refused to grant an audience to the Commissioners of the Parliament who
came to London, not so much on account of the object stated in their
commission as an account of the nature of the authority on which it
was based. Thereupon the principal member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> of
the Commission, Lord Loudon, did not hesitate to turn to the French
ambassador with a declaration that Scotland reckoned upon the support
of the crown of France in the event of a breach with Charles I. A Scot
of the name of Dishingtoun was the agent of the negotiations between
Lord Loudon and the ambassador. The Scots announced their intention
of requesting the King of France, if their dispute with Charles I
were not shortly adjusted, to take cognisance of it according to the
terms of their old alliance, and to mediate between them and their
sovereign; and, in case this was impossible, to afford them protection
against him. They remarked, that they would easily have been able to
come to an understanding with the German sovereigns or with the Dutch
instead, but that they were convinced their petition would not be
rejected by France; and, if they were right in this, that they were
determined to conclude no agreement with their King which did not
allow full restoration of the alliance between France and Scotland.
We cannot help asking how this alliance could have been contemplated
after the crowns of England and Scotland had been united on one head.
The ambassador had himself intimated that the participation of the
Scots in Charles’ Council for the management of foreign affairs would
be necessary to effect that object. The Scots not only caught up this
notion, but turned it into a demand for a high degree of political
independence. They wished that the King should henceforward not be
allowed to proclaim war without applying to the Scottish Parliament on
the subject; the Scots must be conceded a regular place, not only in
the management of foreign affairs in the Council, but also about the
King’s person in the offices of his household; they must have liberty
even to keep plenipotentiaries in France as well as at the Hague<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.
Not until these designs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> were accomplished
could those political results be achieved, which the General Assembly
and the Parliament had desired to bring about, in order to promote
the independence of the Church, and the change of the constitution,
by which the previous influence of the crown was to be excluded. The
independence which the Parliament demanded in the conduct of internal
affairs was now to be extended to its relation with foreign powers as
well.</p>

<p>Bellièvre had entirely approved of the articles which were communicated
to him, for they could only redound to the advantage of France: thus
also hopes were held out to him of concluding a treaty of commerce in
the interests of France, and to the prejudice of England. The proposals
coincided with the most cherished aims of the ambassador; he regarded
the severance of the policy of Scotland from that of England as the
great object of his efforts. But if we are asked whether Richelieu also
was of this opinion, and especially whether he thought it permissible,
while France and England were at peace, to support a movement so
decidedly hostile, we can only reply that such was not his view. Soon
after the beginning of the proceedings he had directly forbidden the
ambassador to mix himself up with the affairs of Scotland. When a
proposed mission from Scotland to France was mentioned, he instructed
the ambassador to prevent it, because at present it could have no
result; for Louis XIII was very conscientious, and would not injure any
one without reason. It was possible, he said, that England, which was
constantly negotiating with Spain, would conclude an alliance with that
power; in that case, the King, on his part, would be ready to enter
into an alliance with the Scots, whom he loved; but until that time it
would be as well to keep back the intended invitation.</p>

<p>He wished to let the Scots cherish the hope which they entertained
of the eventual support of France, but affairs were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1639.</span> not in such a state as to encourage him in the wish to make
common cause with them openly at this moment.</p>

<p>The Scots however proceeded on their way. A letter is extant, much
disputed it is true, but of indubitable authenticity; it is signed by
six of the principal leaders, among whom we find Montrose, but not
Argyle. In this letter the writers claim the protection of France,
and formally accredit an ambassador named Colvil at the court of
Louis XIII; even the instructions are extant which they gave to
him. According to these, Colvil was commissioned to represent their
grievances in Paris, especially touching three points—the illegality
of the High Commission, the declaration of Charles I that the Scots
were rebels, and the dissolution of the last Parliament, not only
without its consent, but even in complete opposition to its wishes.
He was to remind the King of the repeated alliances between the two
nations, and of the services rendered by the Scots to the royal house
of France: and he was to invite the King to procure for them, by
mediating with their sovereign, a renewal of the enjoyment of their
privileges<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.</p>

<p>The attention of Charles I had long before been called to the connexion
formed between the French and the Scots; his confidential agents were
now indefatigable in seeking to come upon the trace of it.</p>

<p>Bellièvre had become odious to the English court, apparently because
he was conjectured to be the agent of that connexion, but still more
because he had taken an active part in the negotiations with regard
to the Spanish fleet, and the journey of the Elector Palatine, and
seemed to be responsible for their unsuccessful issue. One day he was
walking up and down in confidential conversation with the King of
England, such as he had for a long time been accustomed to hold: the
conversation turned on the imprisonment of the Elector Palatine; the
ambassador made a proposal; the King suddenly checked himself, and
said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> he felt at a disadvantage in these
negotiations; that the ambassador was prepared beforehand with his
proposals; that he, the King, was not, and that he must ask him not to
make much account of what he said to him; that if the ambassador wished
to have a precise answer, he must hand him in a written question; that
he should receive a written answer in return, and that this answer
alone would be valid. The ambassador felt the full force of this
intimation; the standing-ground upon which he had hitherto rested began
to sink under him. He had certainly at one time expressed himself
to the King in unfavourable terms with regard to the Queen; he now
experienced a counter action from that side. The personal friends of
the Queen he regarded as his enemies. These were Percy, Montague, and
Jermyn, from whom he was already estranged, because they were friends
of the Queen-mother. He had introduced the alliance with the Scots
chiefly in order to counteract the influence which they exercised in
favour of Spain. He said indeed that more was ascribed to him than he
had done: that he was thought more dexterous, more active, and more
dangerous than he was: but nevertheless it is apparent, if we consider
his proceedings, that he had a great share in producing the growing
ill-feeling between the two courts, and even in fomenting internal
disputes. For not only the Scots, but all those who even in England
were in opposition to the court attached themselves to him. How deep an
influence can in general be exercised by the machinations of foreign
ambassadors at a time of internal dissension, especially when those
machinations are supported by governments of strong and well-understood
political tendencies! An instance of this is afforded by the influence
exercised by the Spanish ambassador at an earlier date in England, and
in France itself at the time of the League. Bellièvre had acquired a
position similar in kind though by no means similar in degree. But he
felt that it was no longer tenable, and in January 1640 he left England.</p>

<p>Not until after his departure did the Scots resolve, as has been
mentioned before, to send an ambassador. Notice of their intention was
first sent to Bellièvre in France: but on this occasion the inquiries
of the English government were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> more successful
than they had been before. The original of the letter addressed to
Louis XIII fell into its hands: it had Colvil arrested, and some time
afterwards, Loudon also, who had again come to London.</p>

<p>Richelieu was very fortunate in having declined to recognise the
mission of Colvil. He had Bellièvre told that the French government had
been wiser than he.</p>

<p>King Charles knew of the hostile intention of the French court: the
strongest impression must have been produced on him when he now also
became aware how cordially it was met on the part of the Scots. He
determined to make the discovery a motive for the resistance which he
wished to offer to his rebellious subjects.</p>

<span class="small">STRAFFORD AND THE SHORT PARLIAMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>About this time the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Viscount Wentworth,
was summoned to England to take a seat in the Council of the King: the
affairs of Scotland were the immediate cause of his return.</p>

<p>The statesmen of England have always been distinguished from those of
other countries by the combination of their activity in the Council
and in the Cabinet with an activity in Parliament, without which they
cannot win their way into the other sphere. Wentworth, like others, had
first made himself a name in Parliament as a resolute and dangerous
opponent of Buckingham. But there was as yet no clear consciousness of
the rule, infinitely important for the moral and political development
of remarkable men, that the activity of a minister must be harmonious
and consistent with his activity as a member of Parliament. In the case
of Wentworth especially it is clear that he opposed the government of
that day, by which he was kept down, only in order to make himself
necessary to it. His natural inclination was, as he once avowed, to
live, not under the frown, but under the smile of his sovereign.
The words of opposition to the government had hardly died away from
his lips, when, at the invitation of that government, he joined it,
although no change had been introduced into its policy. He accepted
the position of Lord President in the North, although the powers of
this office, which transgressed the ordinary limits of jurisdiction,
were repugnant to those conceptions of English law of which he had just
before been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> the champion. He had been trained
beforehand for an office of this kind in the school of the Law Courts,
principally by the proceedings of the Star Chamber, which he had
attended for five years; he was afterwards for a time a Justice of the
Peace, and had the reputation of knowing, perhaps better than any one
in England, what was required for the exercise of that office. Nature,
inclination, and ability, united in fitting him to wield authority.
The Council of the North, which embraced the counties of Yorkshire,
Northumberland, and Westmoreland, the bishopric of Durham, the towns
of Newcastle, York, and Hull, was restored by him, in spite of all
opposition, to the high position which it had possessed under the
Tudors. Charles I assisted him in this enterprise by conferring fresh
powers upon him. But Wentworth afterwards found a far larger arena for
his activity as Lord Deputy of Ireland, where we have already met with
him, and where, for the first time for centuries, obedience to the
King was once more enforced. He despised the custom, adopted by former
viceroys, of coming to an agreement beforehand with the native nobility
about the measures that were to be taken; his only counsellors were the
exigencies of the country, his only support was the royal authority
itself. He derived great advantage from the exclusive possession of
the initiative in Parliament, which was enjoyed by the government
in Ireland: he there brought his idea of the royal prerogative
into practical operation; he declared to the members without any
circumlocution, that reward, or even punishment, awaited each of them
according to his behaviour during the deliberations. The resolutions
of Parliament served him as his instruments in ruling the country; he
put an army into the field, and found means to pay it: for the first
time the revenues of Ireland covered the outgoings; the island was
protected from piracies by its own naval power. While he remitted
many oppressive burdens in favour of the Catholics, he yet gave fresh
encouragement to the Protestant Churches by the agency of learned
bishops and theologians; he maintained the conformity between the Irish
and English Churches, which by his decisive word he had restored. Under
him justice was regularly administered, principally for the protection
of the humble and weak; he considered that in his position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1639.</span> he was justified in directing arbitrary measures against
the great, if at the same time he did not come into collision with the
actual letter of the law, which he was careful not to do. The impulses
of natural imperiousness he nevertheless moderated by deliberating with
prudent confidants<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. If Ireland, which needed the adjustment of
internal rivalries and enmities, not by counsel but by a strong arm,
had alone been concerned, Wentworth would certainly have been the right
man for the government of that country; for he was, as it were, born
to conduct administration according to his own judgment of what was
best: he was indisputably one of the greatest of the administrators
who rose up among the English before they gained possession of India.
But nevertheless Ireland could only be governed on those principles
which prevailed in the rest of the kingdom. What if these were in
contradiction to the principles which he himself followed? The Lord
Deputy was of opinion, and he thought the King’s system required, that
the whole realm should be governed as he governed Ireland.</p>

<p>Thomas Wentworth was a man of lofty stature, who although still in the
full strength of manhood, already stooped as he walked. When he was
seated and immersed in reflection, a cloud seemed to rest upon his
face; when he raised himself and gave expression to his thoughts his
countenance appeared cheerful and almost radiant: he spoke fluently
and with effect; and he had the gift of quick apprehension and apt
rejoinder.</p>

<p>In the narrow circle of persons among whom the affairs of Scotland
were first debated, Laud, Wentworth, and Hamilton, the opinion was
quickly arrived at, that nothing could be done without resorting
to arms. But the importance of the matter made it indispensable to
bring the question also before a full sitting of the Privy Council,
to which all the members were summoned. Traquair was present on this
occasion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1639.</span> and delivered a speech about the
late proceedings in Scotland. Charles put the question, whether he
should concede the demands of the Scots, which in his opinion were
inconsistent with the honour of the King and the obedience due to him
in temporal matters, or whether he should not rather bring back the
people to their duty by force of arms. Every individual was invited to
give his opinion on the subject. The Council answered unanimously that
it was now advisable to have recourse to arms. But it still remained
to consider how Charles should obtain the means requisite for the war;
whether, on this occasion at all events, he should not seek to obtain
them in the ordinary way by the help of Parliament. It seems strange at
first sight that the smaller body which surrounded the King expressed
itself favourably to this plan. But the necessity of such a step had
been already foreseen when the King resolved not to go on from Berwick
into Scotland; for the most important turns are given to affairs at a
few decisive moments. Hamilton had at that time already remarked that
the King would be obliged to employ force, and to claim a grant of
Parliament for that purpose<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. Yet the royal councillors did not
intend thereby to make themselves entirely dependent on the opinion of
Parliament. On the contrary, they definitely set before themselves the
possibility that Parliament might refuse its assistance. And perhaps
they looked forward with no great anxiety to an unfavourable result.
They were of opinion that in such a case the King would be justified in
the eyes of God and man, if he had recourse to the extraordinary means
which he was still trying to avoid.</p>

<p>The summoning of a Parliament was also approved at a meeting of the
Privy Council: the anticipation was expressed that Parliament would
take the honour of the King into consideration, and would provide him
with the necessary subsidies. The King, who knew the temper of the
people, was not satisfied with this conclusion: he put forward the
possibility that Parliament might perhaps even oppose his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1639.</span> wishes, and he submitted to the assembled Councillors the
question whether in such a case they would support him in resorting to
extraordinary means. They unanimously and cheerfully declared ‘that
in such case they would assist him with their lives and fortunes, in
such extraordinary way, as should be advised and found best for the
preservation of his state and government<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.’ On this the King gave
out that he would summon the English Parliament for the ensuing 13th of
April.</p>

<p>The prospect of a successful issue of the negotiations with Parliament
was not perhaps in the first instance altogether hopeless. Some old
members gave an assurance that the House of Commons would on this
occasion remain within its proper limits, and would agree to the
necessary grants. Some effect was expected from the impression which
the connexion between the Scots and the French, that was by degrees
coming to light, could not fail to produce upon Englishmen of the
genuine old stamp. The Puritans themselves had been put into an ill
humour with the French and their selfish policy by the imprisonment
of the Elector Palatine, from whose appearance in Germany they had
expected great things. People had said that in the next war the English
arms might be turned against France as easily as against Scotland<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>;
and the Queen, at all events, had now no objection to such a measure.
She had been formerly an opponent of Wentworth, whose ambition had
been represented to her as dangerous; she was now one of his admirers,
as were also her friends the Countess of Carlisle and the Duchess of
Chevreuse. The most influential members of her household, her intimate
friends Jermyn and Montague, passed for the most decided adversaries of
the French. Yet there were some who adhered to their side: the Earl of
Holland would not be deterred from visiting Bellièvre, even when he lay
under the displeasure of the court; but he and his friends feared for
the results of the next Parliament. They thought that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1639.</span> dominant party had laid their plans so well that they would
maintain their ascendancy<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>: that the King would allow only the
affairs of Scotland and the imprisonment of the Elector to be brought
under discussion: that his design was to hold a Parliament according to
his own views, and after his own fashion, and to become more powerful
by its assistance than any of his ancestors had ever been. It was
thought that the opposite party had already resolved, if all went well,
not to spare the heads of their opponents.</p>

<p>The opposition of religious opinions, the great European interests at
stake, and the most important questions of internal policy, were mixed
up with the quarrels of persons in high positions, who, in the event
of a political defeat, would, according to old English custom, have to
fear even for their lives.</p>

<p>The King had resolved that an Irish Parliament should precede the
sitting of Parliament in England. Wentworth, who was not until now
raised to a rank fully equal to his position, was nominated Lord
Lieutenant in Ireland, and at the same time was made Earl of Strafford,
which was the name of the wapentake in which Wentworth-Wodehouse was
situated, where his ancestors had resided since the Conquest. He had
now to go over to Ireland once more, in order to bring matters there to
a successful issue.</p>

<p>He fully realised to himself the importance, the difficulty, and even
the danger of his position.</p>

<p>In his gratitude for his promotion in rank he once more expressed the
opinion that the kingship was an image of the Divine Majesty. After
his journey to Ireland, where he had to endure an attack of gout, he
writes that whether in health or suffering, whether lame or blind, he
would at all times be found faithful to the service of his lord. He
promises to be back in England at the opening of Parliament, even if
he should be tormented with pain, even though he might have to expect
to find his most violent enemies in that body; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1640.</span> strongly urges that everything should meanwhile be carefully
prepared beforehand in England as well as in Ireland, and especially
that the raising of troops, which had been resolved on, should not be
delayed. ‘For that this work before us,’ he says, ‘should it miscarry,
we are all like to be very miserable: but carried through advisedly
and gallantly, it shall by God’s blessing set us in safety and peace
for our lives after, nay, in probability, the generations that are to
succeed us. Fi a faute de courage: je n’en ay que trop. What might I be
with my legs that am so brave without the use of them<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p>In Ireland the Lord Lieutenant easily attained his object. On March 23,
the very same day on which he invoked the loyalty of the King’s Irish
subjects against the Scottish Covenanters, whose designs he declared to
be detestable, the Irish granted four subsidies, adding that they were
ready, in case the war continued, to devote all their possessions, and
even their persons, to the service of the King. Further measures were
taken to equip an army of 8000 men, with cavalry and artillery. Thus,
after a stay of fourteen days, in which he had successfully executed
his plans, Strafford recrossed St. George’s Channel.</p>

<p>At the English Court meanwhile negotiations with the Scots had been
resumed, but the commission appointed by the King to manage the affair
decided that, if Scotland did not first of all acknowledge both those
rights, without which no supreme authority could exist, namely, the
right of convening and dissolving deliberative assemblies in Church and
State, as well as of vetoing any measure proposed in these assemblies,
no further negotiation could be carried on with that country.
Strafford, successful and full of conscious pride in consequence of his
success in Ireland, thought that matters had been so skilfully arranged
that the Scottish war would be ended as soon as begun, and that the
Earl of Argyle would sell his cause at a cheap price.</p>

<p>The eyes of every one in the three kingdoms were now turned upon the
English Parliament, to which the question was submitted, whether it
would support its sovereign in his position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> in
Europe, and, above all, maintain him in his sovereignty over Scotland,
or whether it would, on the contrary, attempt to give effect to its own
ancient but hitherto repressed claims.</p>

<p>On April 13/23, 1640, the Parliament, as had been announced, was
opened. The Lord Keeper above all things set before them the necessity
of giving the King assistance against the Scots. He read the despatch
of the six Scottish nobles already referred to, by which Colvil had
been accredited at the court of the King of France, whom in the
despatch, after French fashion, they simply called ‘The King.’ Charles
I himself added a few words on the matter. The Lord Keeper’s proposal
aimed at securing an immediate grant of adequate subsidies; without
this, it was said, the war could not be conducted, and yet it must
be waged in the following summer. A formal approval of tonnage and
poundage which the King, under the pressure of necessity, had hitherto
collected without approval, was also now proposed. If these grants
should be made, which the King regarded as a pledge of the affection
and loyalty of his subjects, he would prove himself on his part, it was
said, a just, gentle, and gracious sovereign; then, and not till then,
might petitions directed to promote the welfare of England be brought
under discussion, and the King would then co-operate with Parliament to
the advantage of the country.</p>

<p>It was intended that, before any further discussion of the questions of
domestic policy at issue, the King should be placed by means of copious
subsidies in a position to revive the royal authority which had been
shaken in Scotland, and, in consequence, everywhere else as well.</p>

<p>It is evident however that the English Parliament could not be moved
to adopt such a course. In the elections the government had been again
as unsuccessful on this occasion as it had been ten or twelve years
before. The boroughs had the preponderance at the elections, and in the
boroughs the party devoted to the Presbyterian and Parliamentary cause
were in the ascendant. The oppression of the system previously pursued,
and the apprehension of worse consequences, had necessarily led to this
result. We learn that even in Westminster the King failed to procure a
seat in the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> of Commons for a confidential
servant of his court: supporters of the Opposition were elected under
his very eyes<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<p>A disadvantageous influence had been exercised from the very first by
the reappearance of the man who had given occasion to the last violent
scenes in the year 1629, and who was in ill repute with every one—John
Finch, who now came forward as Lord Keeper. His appearance awakened the
old controversies and the old hatred.</p>

<p>And moreover the disloyalty of the Scots failed to produce so great
an impression as was expected, because it was partly a result of
the religious conflict. France was regarded as the protector of
Protestantism, which, on the contrary, was in danger from a King who
belonged to it. The French government had not been slow to release
the Elector Palatine from prison, on the receipt of the warning which
was addressed to it; it had removed this cause of offence as well as
others, and in both Houses of Parliament it reckoned decided partisans.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Charles I was encountered in the Parliament
of 1640 by an opposition no less resolute than that which had led to
the dissolution of the Parliament of 1629.</p>

<p>The very first speaker who made himself heard, Grimstone, set off
domestic grievances against the complaints which the King made of
the Scots; he dwelt above all on the infringement of the obligations
undertaken by the acceptance of the Petition of Right. He said that
freedom and property had been shaken, the Church thrown into confusion,
and the true religion even persecuted. While appealing for support to
a passage of the Bible he gave utterance to the significant opinion
that men ought to enquire how this result had come to pass, and who had
given the advice which had brought it about.</p>

<p>Then rose up John Pym, the man of all others in that assembly in whom
the union of Puritan and Parliamentary principles was most clearly
displayed. He had drawn up for himself a list of the grievances,
which he now set forth, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> methodical and
almost scholastic accuracy, but with clear vision, and not without
statesmanlike insight. He gave especial prominence to the religious
grievances, to the failure in executing the ancient laws in consequence
of which men of the Catholic faith were placed in positions of trust
and power, and to the presence of a Papal Resident in England, who,
he said, was only carrying into execution what a congregation sitting
at Rome was devising for the conversion of England. It was necessary,
he affirmed, to consider the Papacy in its connexion with the other
states which it governed, as the sun governs the course of the planets;
he thought it was intended that England also should be torn from her
proper path and subjected to the same influence<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<p>To this origin—for everything, he said, had its source—most of
the abuses were then referred by him and by others; especially the
suspension of the sittings of Parliament, and the attacks made on
private property by the collection of taxes which had not been granted,
measures intended to relieve the government from any need of convening
that body<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.</p>

<p>The various complaints of a similar nature which came in from every
county and every class made all the stronger impression, as they were
also based on the ground of a general danger to the religion ‘which was
professed according to the law of God and the law of the land.’</p>

<p>These all showed the same conception of the King’s intentions as that
entertained by the Scots, although much more moderately expressed; yet,
for all that, it cannot be accepted as resting on an historical basis.
The efforts of the government certainly proceeded from one fundamental
design, but this was the design of uniting the three kingdoms in a
like obedience, not by the acceptance of Catholicism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1640.</span> but only by more lenient treatment of it; according to
the King’s idea, Great Britain far from again becoming a satellite
of the Papacy, was, on the contrary, to describe its own course as
an independent portion of the universe, while external influence was
to be neutralised. But nevertheless Pym’s assertions made a great
impression even in England. In the religious conflict which filled the
world neutrality might well seem to be partiality to one side; the
danger lay, not merely in the intention of the ruler, but in the nature
of things, which often exercises an influence even beyond that of
individuals.</p>

<p>The controversy was connected with a question which has always been one
of the most important in those countries which have a highly developed
representative constitution. When, on April 23, at the wish of the
government the proposal was made to allow the granting of subsidies to
precede the discussion of grievances, this proposal, after long debate,
was rejected in the House of Commons; it was thought that it ought not
to set so bad an example to posterity. The House came to a resolution
to grant no money, unless it received at all events simultaneously the
definite assurance of redress on those three points under which all
others were comprised—security for religion, for property, and for
Parliamentary liberties.</p>

<p>By this resolution the House of Commons at once placed itself in
opposition to the intentions of the government, which required
grants of money without delay. For what a wide prospect must have
been opened by the discussion of these points even in a friendly and
indulgent spirit! On the evening of the same day a meeting of the Privy
Council was held, and, at Strafford’s proposal, although not without
opposition, a resolution was taken to bring the matter before the
House of Lords. Not that the power of granting subsidies was ascribed
to that House; the formal question was laid before it, whether the
King ought first to give satisfaction to his subjects, or to expect
satisfaction from them<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> House of
Lords a tendency in favour of the opposition was not wanting: the Earls
of Southampton and Rutland, and Lords Say and Brooke were against the
King’s proposal. But the majority were still decidedly in favour of
the government; and a resolution was passed that the satisfaction to
be given to the King must precede the discussion of grievances<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.
The members of Convocation without waiting any longer granted the King
six subsidies. The House of Commons in great excitement remarked that
its rights were thereby trenched upon, as the granting of subsidies
belonged to that House alone<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>. Hereon the House of Lords once
more took the matter into consideration on the 29th of April; but on
a second division they arrived at just the same result as before. The
Lords again took the side of the government by a majority of twenty
votes.</p>

<p>The King considered this an important advantage, and Strafford as the
only man whose advice he could follow. He said to him that he had more
confidence in him than in all the Privy Council together, and the Queen
spoke of him as her husband’s most capable and trustworthy minister.</p>

<p>With renewed hopes of a favourable issue, especially as the Lords had
explained their views at full length to the Commons, the King had his
proposal again brought before the latter House a few days afterwards
by the Treasurer of the royal household, Sir Henry Vane. In the sketch
of the message to be submitted to it, very strong expressions were
originally inserted with regard to the delay of the grant, which was
represented as unprecedented in such a case; the King, however, for
fear of making bad blood, had struck them out with his own hand. The
Treasurer merely represented in the most urgent terms the necessity of
the grant, without which, he said, the honour of the King and of the
State would be in danger; delay in this matter was no less pernicious
than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> a refusal<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. The subject was again
taken into consideration at once; it continued to be the unaltered
feeling of the House that the removal of grievances in Church and State
must first be taken in hand; its answer however was still kept back.</p>

<p>At the court it was thought that a grant might still be obtained, at
all events by the offer of concessions; and the King had a declaration
made that he would give up ship-money if twelve subsidies were promised
him. It was not the sum which people would have had to pay that kept
them from accepting this offer. The Speaker, Sergeant Glanville,
who rose to address the House, (the debate was being carried on in
Committee,) calculated, judging from his own case, that the tax would
not fall very heavily on each individual, but he did not for that
reason advise Parliament to accede to the offer; for, as he affirmed,
this would be to acknowledge the payment of ship-money as binding, and
would indirectly be authorising it. Glanville was regarded as one of
the greatest authorities upon legal questions; and a deep impression
was made by his declaration that ship-money was against the laws, if he
understood anything about them. Others suggested other motives besides,
but the legal point was decisive. Sir Henry Vane, when he came out of
the House, told the King that he ought not to reckon upon obtaining any
grant.</p>

<p>That this was in fact the case is not quite certain; but such was
the impression which was made by the proceedings. The government
thought they had tangible proof that Parliament would grant the King
no subsidies, or, at all events, would grant them only under such
conditions as ran counter to his system of government. It would not
content itself with any mere removal of grievances by the act of the
sovereign, for it thought that the interference of Parliament was
necessary for the cure of national evils: the King was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1640.</span> to be pledged for ever to abide by parliamentary procedure. The
King found himself not merely forsaken but threatened with further
demonstrations; he did not hesitate, before such demonstrations were
actually made, to declare the dissolution of this Parliament, as he had
that of others<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> (May 5, 1640).</p>

<p>This was a decision of all the more importance inasmuch as no
resolutions of Parliament, properly speaking, had yet been arrived
at; and another decision of no less consequence, with reference to
the resumption of the Scottish war, immediately followed. In the
Commission appointed to consider the subject attention had indeed been
called to the insufficiency of the means available for the support
of an offensive war; the question was asked, whether it would not be
better in the first instance to leave the Scots alone. But, as we know,
the leading men had already prepared themselves for an unfavourable
issue of the deliberations of Parliament, and had determined not to
allow themselves to be thwarted on that account. The Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland encouraged the King to proceed boldly. He said that a
merely defensive attitude would diminish his reputation; that he would
exhaust and weaken himself, and would stand, as it were, between Saul
and David; that no long time could elapse before England rose to
support him. He said that an offensive war had been already decided
on; that the King should undertake it; that, as Parliament refused its
assistance, he was justified in the sight of God and man if, under the
pressure of these circumstances, he should seize every other means
which lay within the grasp of his power; that he had an army in Ireland
of which he could avail himself; that Scotland could be subdued in a
single summer. Were it his own affair, he added, he would make the
venture; he would either carry it through or lose everything in the
attempt. Archbishop Laud supported the views of the Lord Lieutenant; he
said that every means had been tried, and all had failed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1640.</span> that if people would not grant the King what according to
God’s law was his due, he had the right to take it. Cottington not only
warmly agreed with Laud, but also added as a general reason for action
that the House of Commons looked forward to getting rid of the monarchy
as well as of the Episcopal Church<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. If he meant a definitely
entertained design, there was as little truth in his statement as there
was in attributing to the King the intention of becoming a Catholic.
Men on either side, judging from what has occurred, attribute to the
opposite party the intentions which are most offensive to themselves.</p>

<p>On this the principle of parliamentary and military, or, which is
much the same, of limited and absolute monarchy, once more came into
conflict with one another in the King’s Privy Council. The latter
obtained a complete ascendancy.</p>

<p>The alliance between Scotland and a foreign power was thought to remove
all doubts regarding its treatment; it was therefore to be attacked by
sea and land at once, from the side both of England and Ireland, with
all the strength which the Crown, unaided by Parliament, had remaining
to it. The militia of the country had already been called out for that
object. It was intended that part of the expense should be defrayed by
the contributions of the Lords, which proved very considerable, and by
those of the clergy<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. Two days after the dissolution of Parliament
the assembled Privy Council embraced the resolution of calling the
High Sheriffs of eight counties, among which were Middlesex, Yorkshire
and Essex, to account for having improperly neglected to collect the
ship-money; they were to be dealt with straightway, without regard
for their rank, and to be treated according to their deserts. A
command was issued to the Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk to punish with
imprisonment all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> men of any position who had
shown themselves contumacious during the levy and on the march of the
troops. Fresh negotiations were begun with a view to obtaining a loan
from Spain. It was also suggested that the silver lying in the Tower
might be coined to more advantage than before. Strafford laid before
the Council a memorial about the French practice of raising forced
loans from the wealthy, and advised imitation of that practice.</p>

<p>Can we be surprised if the opinion gained ground that the war against
Scotland, which was not in itself necessary, was intended to serve as a
means of introducing absolute monarchy on the French and Spanish model
into England also. Without doubt men like Strafford, Laud, Cottington,
and the King himself, thought of realising, despite of all opposition
in England and Scotland, the ideal of a monarchy resting on a spiritual
basis.</p>

<p>A document is extant which indisputably sets forth this intention.
This is the Book of Canons, drawn up in the Convocation of the clergy,
which held its deliberations at the same time as the Parliament. In
this book a theory as to the royal authority, not very unlike the views
which Richelieu and his adherents were then contending for in France,
was strongly asserted as the doctrine of the Church. It is therein
said that the monarchy is the highest and most sacred Estate, is of
divine right, is expressly instituted in the Old and New Testament for
ruling over every one, of whatever rank and position he might be, and
is entrusted even with the supreme government of the Church. Whoever
wished to set up a power independent of the King’s, whether of Papal or
popular character, thereby placed himself, it was said, in opposition
to the Divine ordinance<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>: it was consonant with the law of nature,
the law of nations, and the law of God, that people should repay the
protection which they enjoyed from the King with tribute, tolls, and
subsidies: for them to bear arms against the King, not merely in order
to attack him, but even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> in order to defend
themselves against him, was to resist the ordinance of God. These
views, which condemned the resistance of the Scots, as well as the
agitation of the popular spirit in England, were proclaimed as the
doctrines of the Church; and an oath in keeping with them was imposed
on the clergy and on the graduates of the universities.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical ideas of Laud, and the political ideas of Strafford,
were in complete harmony with one another. Though it was perhaps still
possible to unite a form of parliamentary government with the monarchy,
such as they would have made it, yet the former could only have been
such as would have been unconditionally subservient to the views of the
crown, and would have regarded their promotion as its own province.</p>

<p>Strafford and Laud were still determined to carry these plans into
execution, and that, in the first instance, by means of the war in
Scotland; and without being really conscious of the powerful forces
which were opposed to them, they cherished the confident hope of
succeeding in their attempt.</p>

<span class="small">THE SCOTS IN ENGLAND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As early as March 1640, on the receipt of the first intelligence of the
warlike designs of Charles I, the Scots had resolved to renew their
preparations for war. Lesley and the other commanders were confirmed
in their posts: in every county people began to arm. Hostilities again
broke out between the castle and the town of Edinburgh: but Ruthven did
not allow himself to be overpowered as easily as his predecessor had
been. When an attack was made upon him he replied to it by an artillery
fire from the walls.</p>

<p>While shots were being exchanged, and men on both sides were falling,
the Scottish Parliament reassembled on June 2. Its proceedings could
not fail to breathe a similar tone of hostility. It met without the
presence of the King or of his commissioner; as men observed with
astonishment ‘without sword, sceptre, and crown.’ In place of the
commissioner the Parliament established a president of its own, elected
from among its members. The session lasted only eight days; but it
was said that for six centuries there had been no Parliament more
remarkable and more thoroughgoing. Those resolutions were repeated,
and even enlarged, which had been adopted in the last session before
it was interrupted by adjournment, and to which the King had refused
his consent. Though hitherto the clergy had taken a high place in the
constitutions of all European kingdoms, even in Northern and German
countries in spite of the Reformation, yet in Scotland it was resolved
that this order should no longer be represented in Parliament. In
its room the gentry appeared as the third order, standing between
the nobles and the citizens: they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> took
definitive possession, as before mentioned, of the political influence
which they had won for themselves in the late commotions. In this
new form, so it was enacted, Parliament was to be held every three
years<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>: proclamations which ran counter to the laws and liberties
of the Parliament were to be forbidden under the penalties attached
to high treason: only natives, and moreover only those natives who
were disposed to protect the reformed religion in the shape in which
it had been established, and to maintain the union between King and
people, were to be appointed to the command of the three strong
castles of Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dumbarton. Such further changes
were introduced into the resolutions as made it necessary that the
most important military commands should be filled according to the
wish of the Estates. The clergy were also excluded from the Courts
of Justice; for people did not wish that an order, which had shown
itself so amenable to the influence exercised on it by the crown,
should be seen exercising any political functions. The inferior clergy
were quite content with this, as the continuance of their Assemblies
and the independence of their jurisdiction was expressly secured to
them. The monarchy was certainly allowed to remain, but care was taken
to surround it with independent powers, which took away from it the
substance of its authority. The Parliament authorised the Committee of
the Estates, which was already appointed, to carry on the government.
This committee was so composed that the resolutions always conformed to
the wishes and proposals of the leading men, especially of Argyle, who
was considered even then as the most important person of all, though he
was not himself one of the members.</p>

<p>We should mistake the feelings of the Scots, if we assumed that
these arrangements had been approved by every one. Even Thomas Hope,
the King’s Advocate, who had at first so entirely concurred in the
movement, warned the Earl of Rothes not to go so far as to give the
King good ground for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> saying to other sovereigns
that people in Scotland had an eye, not so much to religion, as to
the abolition of the monarchy. Hope told the Earl that they ought to
strengthen their religion, that they should then see what he would
do or suffer in its behalf, but that in matters of civil government
they must not reckon on his going with them. The same views were
entertained by many other of the more reflecting spirits among the
clergy and scholars. The government had thought it necessary to appoint
as Professors in the Universities men who shared its tendencies, and
knew how to gain acceptance for them in the minds of the young. These
regulations did not enjoy entire popularity. While in the English
Parliament the boroughs returned a majority, in Scotland the gentry
had an ascendancy by which the commons, at first at all events, felt
themselves oppressed<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>. And meanwhile the Covenant was not yet
by any means everywhere accepted. Those counties that repudiated it
even made attacks upon others which had submitted: the old Scottish
lawlessness and desire for plunder now availed itself of religious
pretexts. A small army was required to be permanently in the field in
order to extinguish the flames of revolt which kept flickering here
and there. In the minds of many of the great men who concurred in the
religious demands of their countrymen, their political demands awakened
all the more opposition because their rivals were just the people who
derived advantage from the new constitution; or else in fact feelings
of loyal devotion to the King awoke in them; they did not wish to allow
the crown to be robbed of all its splendour and all its power.</p>

<p>One might almost wonder that the dominant party was still in such good
spirits.</p>

<p>For even the arming which had been determined on proceeded but slowly;
it appeared hardly possible to collect a serviceable body of cavalry.
A tithe-penny had been laid upon property; but in order to collect it
a valuation of property would have been necessary, and hence a great
difficulty arose. From the first extreme measures were necessary; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> example, the exaction from private individuals
of the silver they had in use, under a guarantee of making good its
value. But, as Baillie says, what was all that compared with the
requirements of the army, for which 20,000 marks were daily needed?
And what would ultimately happen, when Scotland was entirely cut off
on the side of Ireland and England from its maritime commerce, as was
intended? The resolutions of the English Privy Council and of the Irish
Parliament created a great impression among the Scots.</p>

<p>A much greater impression however was now created by the proceedings of
the English Parliament.</p>

<p>It has been always assumed that the Scots were strengthened in their
attitude and induced to determine on advancing into England by
overtures from English peers in the ranks of the opposition. And there
is no doubt that invitations of this kind reached them.</p>

<p>Lord Loudon, the man who had first formed a connexion with the French,
and who was one of those who had signed the letter to the King of
France already referred to, had been thrown into the Tower immediately
before the opening of Parliament; but he there received visits from
English peers, and among others from Lord Savile. The Saviles were
old opponents of the Wentworths: their families imported their county
quarrels into public affairs. It was indeed by the favour shown to a
Savile at one time that Wentworth had been driven into the ranks of the
opposition. The high position to which, on the other hand, a Wentworth
now rose, may have contributed to turn Lord Savile into an opponent of
the whole system<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. So far as we know, he is the man through whom
it was intimated to Loudon as the wish of some English lords, that
the Scots should advance on England with their army. Shortly after
the dissolution of Parliament, Loudon received permission to return
to Scotland<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>: he immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> sought out
Argyle, who was still stationed with his small army in the North,
in order to apprise him of the position of affairs. But it was not
possible that the expressions of a peer, who was not even one of the
most important members of his order, should afford sufficient security.
Then Savile, who had always affirmed that he was the spokesman of
many other nobles and gentlemen, sent in a declaration on the part of
some others of great name, the Earls of Warwick and Essex, Lords Say,
Brooke, and Mandeville, in which the Scots were invited to cross over
into England. The genuineness of the signatures was denied afterwards
in terms, the truth of which can hardly be called in question. The
Scots however at that time could entertain no suspicion of deception.
And this invitation undoubtedly produced a great impression upon them,
as they could now venture to count upon the support of a considerable
portion of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>But the attitude of the House of Commons no doubt supplied them with
the principal motive for their decisions. As the Scots affirm in their
manifesto, after they had been proclaimed as rebels in every parish
church, the English Parliament—convoked with the sole purpose of
supporting a war against them—could not be moved by any threatenings,
fears, promises, or hopes, to grant any subsidies for the war, but
had rather undertaken to justify the Scots by parallel complaints and
statements of grievances. The Scots now laid the greatest emphasis
upon the coincidence of the interests of both realms. The only design
of both kingdoms, they said, was the maintenance of true religion, and
of the just liberties of the subject; but the King was surrounded by
a faction which was endeavouring to set up superstition and bondage
in place of religion: it was intended by the war against the Scots to
stir up the English against them that they might with their own swords
extirpate their own religion; set up a new Rome in their midst, and
establish the slavery of both countries for ever. With such adversaries
no agreement could be concluded: no just desires were listened to
by them: to sit still and wait their hostility would be contrary to
sense and religion: they themselves, the Scots, were determined to
seek in England their own peace, the maintenance of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1640.</span> laws, and the punishment of the enemies of both kingdoms.
It might perhaps be doubtful whether it was warrantable for them
to advance into England, but there was a necessity which justified
proceedings of this sort, and constituted a law above all laws. ‘The
question is not,’ they say, ‘whether we shall content ourselves with
our own poverty, or enrich ourselves in England: that question is
impious and absurd. But this is the question, whether it be wisdome
and piety to keep ourselves within the Borders till our throats be
cut, and our Religion, Lawes, and Countrey be destroyed; or shall wee
bestirre ourselves and seeke our Safeguard, Peace, and Liberty in
England. Or shall we fold our hands, and waite for the perfect slavery
of our selves, and our posterity in our Souls, Bodies, and Estates, and
(which is all one) foolishly to stand to our defence where we know it
is impossible; or shall we seek our reliefe in following the calling
of God (for our necessity can be interpreted to be no lesse), and
entering by the doore which his providence hath opened unto us, when
all wayes are stopped beside?’ They do not enter into a full statement
of the innovations which had been undertaken in their Parliament; they
hardly touch upon them; they bring into prominence only the great
questions from which everything had sprung, and they express the hope
that England will sympathise with them in the stress of affairs which
compelled them to overstep their borders, and will aid them in the
measures which they are taking to obtain their just desires. They
promise that in their advance they will exact nothing by force: but
should their resources be exhausted they reckon upon the support of the
English<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>.</p>

<p>This lofty mode of expression, to which a certain amount of truth
cannot be denied, accounts for the silence of all opposition, at all
events in those circles which had attached themselves to the religious
cause for which the Scots contended. In the army moreover there were
men serving who did not wish to see the monarchy put down. In all the
churches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> prayers were offered for the General,
who purposed to go to England with his army, and to confer with the
King.</p>

<p>In the latter half of July, the army mustered at Cheslaw Wood, near
Dunse; one half of the Committee of Estates was to accompany it,
the other half was to remain behind. It was not intended to take
Highlanders across the border. Argyle led his own men into the field
against the Ogilvies and the district of Athol, where the opposition
was kept up. It was not until August 18 that the army broke up from
the place of rendezvous. There may have been somewhat over 20,000
men: with the native leaders of high rank there were associated a
number of captains who had gained experience in the German war, and
who maintained military discipline. Lesley, who was connected with the
former by political sympathies, and with the latter by common service
in past time, was again invested with the supreme command.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards the Scots crossed the river Tweed, the boundary
between the two countries. The cavalry halted in the water, in order
to break the force of the stream, while the infantry waded across.
Montrose dismounted from his horse, and marched over at the head of his
regiment; he was the first of them all to tread on English soil.</p>

<p>The Scots did not find any dispositions made to meet them at the
border; they advanced into Northumberland without opposition. It was
only on arriving at the fords of the Tyne that they came upon a couple
of breastworks upon which cannon were planted. They set up a camp,
around which hundreds of coal-fires illuminated the horizon; they still
however refrained from making any attack.</p>

<p>The engagement which then ensued is characteristic of the state of
feeling. On the morning of the 28th a Scottish officer, wearing a hat
with a black feather, rode his horse to the Tyne, in order to water it.
An English musketeer, seeing the Scot fix his eye upon the breastworks,
could not resist the temptation; he aimed well, and the officer fell
wounded from his horse. Upon this the Scottish musketeers opened fire
in return; both sides discharged their artillery upon their opponents.
But the camp of the Scots was in a higher and stronger position than
that of the English; they had also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> without
doubt, more practised artillerymen, and the English found themselves
outmatched. But this was quite enough to bring the matter to a crisis.
The English troops in the entrenchments complained that they had not
been relieved from Newcastle as they should have been; they murmured
that they were expected to do double duty. But they did not give vent
to their discontent in words alone. They gave ear for a few minutes
longer to the exhortations of their commander; but when they found
that they had the worst of it, and were in danger from the Scottish
artillery, they immediately abandoned their works and threw away their
weapons, not so much from cowardice as from ill-humour excited by the
war and the bad arrangements which had been made. On this the Scots,
both horse and foot, under cover of their cannon, crossed the Tyne. The
English were then completely driven from all their positions. On the
next morning Lord Conway abandoned Newcastle<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.</p>

<p>Not less significant was the manner in which this town was taken
possession of by the Scots, into whose hands, on the retreat of the
troops, it inevitably fell.</p>

<p>The leader of a troop of Scots, James Douglas, on approaching the
town found the magistrates at the bridge. He told them that the Scots
were come to speak with their gracious King; that they carried in one
hand a petition in favour of their rights and religion, in the other
the sword, in order to defend themselves against the enemies who
placed themselves between them and their King; that their hope was
that their brethren of Newcastle would unite themselves with them for
the advantage of both churches and kingdoms, and would, in the first
place, allow them supplies of provisions and ammunition. The mayor
and aldermen observed that such conduct was against their duty; and
that as the Scots were subjects of the same sovereign as themselves,
they hoped that no violence would be employed against them. The Scots
replied that that would certainly be unavoidable if their requirements
were not voluntarily satisfied. On the next day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span>
they occupied the gates of the town, and encamped their cavalry in
them, while the infantry entrenched themselves upon the neighbouring
heights. They first took provisions and munitions of war from the royal
magazines; they then made out a requisition; the inhabitants were
compelled to accept the Covenant, notwithstanding the fact that they
were Englishmen; whoever opposed them was treated as a public enemy.</p>

<p>It was remarked as a flagrant inconsistency in the conduct of the
Scots, that they continued to pray for the King in their public
worship, while at the same time they prayed for the army which was
advancing into the field against him. But the whole nature of their
rising was involved in the same contradiction. While they were pressing
forward into England with arms in their hands, and were taking up a
strong position there, they still kept affirming that they were loyal
subjects, as their demands were founded on the laws, and that even now
they prayed for nothing but that the King should take these demands
into consideration and grant them.</p>

<p>The royal army had meanwhile assembled in York. The Earl of Strafford,
who had undertaken the command, together with the King, who himself
was present with it, even appeared not displeased to see the Scots
invade England, as he thought that such a proceeding would serve to
rouse the old English feeling of hatred against them. He reminded the
gentry of York of the old wars, of which the present was, he said,
merely a repetition: he said that religion was only a pretext with
the Scots; that their object was rebellion and invasion. He declared
that the law of nature, reason, and the law of England demanded that
they should support the King with their persons and property against
them; to deny this would be ignorance, to hesitate would be little
less than treachery. He added, that they ought not to allow the Scots
to taste the superior advantages of the English soil; that they must
attach themselves to the King’s cause, or run the risk of losing
everything<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span>

<p>Strafford obstinately persisted in the line of policy which he
had once taken up. He persisted in attributing to the Scots those
very intentions of which they declared their horror. Even in the
proclamation of the King the enterprise of the Scots was described as
a raid of freebooters, after the fashion of former centuries<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. The
spiritual and temporal lords were summoned in the style of former ages,
to join the King’s standard with the followers whom they were bound to
bring.</p>

<p>Strafford still hoped to put down the opponents of the sovereign
authority in both countries. He thought to bring the strength of
England into the field by the means which formerly had been at the
service of the crown; he intended that the very revolt of the Scots
should help him to subdue them. A new battle of Flodden Field would
have restored the monarchy as it once existed, on both sides of the
border.</p>

<p>No one will make any very heavy political charge against Strafford on
the score of his government of Ireland, or of the partisan attitude
which he had taken up in the intestine struggle in England in general;
for the ideas for which he contended were as much to be found in the
past history of England as were those which he attacked. His royalist
principles are not without basis and elevation; he at all events had
no conscious intention of proceeding to employ illegal violence. The
greatest blame which falls upon him is incurred by his behaviour
during these days; his mistake lay in wishing to treat England in the
same way as Ireland: but a past success is an evil counsellor under
circumstances which are entirely different; both he and his sovereign
were deficient in the sense of what was practicable in England. While
they in their zeal were proceeding to the most extreme assertion of the
prerogative for which old precedent could be found, they were placed in
a position where such an assertion could no longer be made with effect.
For whatever may be the nature of laws, they never can be executed
unless, to a certain extent, they are voluntarily accepted. Strafford’s
most imprudent act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> was the prosecution of
the war against Scotland, after Parliament had refused to grant the
subsidies necessary for that object. However large the sums which the
Lords might contribute in accordance with the pledge which they had
given, it was clear that these would not suffice to carry on a great
war. But what resources were left when these were exhausted?</p>

<p>In that case the King would have to depend principally on the city
of London. But this was the very place in which the dominant system
had provoked the greatest discontent: nowhere were there more staunch
supporters of parliamentary government. A proof of this assertion may
be found in the tumult which broke out in the capital after the last
dissolution of Parliament, and was directed against the Archbishop of
Canterbury, who was threatened with death by an excited multitude.
These disturbances had been quieted and their promoters punished;
but placards were constantly put up indicative of the same feelings.
For a long time the Archbishop did not venture to return to Lambeth;
he considered himself secure only in the King’s palaces. The middle
classes were excited rather than disposed to compliance by a threat,
which Strafford held out, of attaching the silver in the Tower, or
of raising the value of the currency. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen
refused the King a loan which he requested, not because they lacked
money, but because it seemed dangerous to allow the necessity of the
consent of Parliament to be called in question in this manner. The
government turned to the Common Council, before which Cottington laid
the most urgent representations: but his proposals were rejected even
by this body. Strafford indeed spoke of treason; for the money, he
said, was in hand, only people refused to lend it to the King under the
circumstances: but the threats which he founded on these statements he
was unable to carry out; even in the Privy Council he met with firm and
well-grounded opposition to his proposals. Tonnage and poundage, as
usual, brought in a certain amount: but ship-money was paid into the
exchequer in smaller quantities even than before. The sheriffs in vain
gave the necessary directions to the bailiffs of the hundreds: they no
longer took the matter up with any zeal, but returned empty-handed. In
this embarrassment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> Charles I betook himself
to the East India Company, to which he proposed that the spices which
it had imported should be handed over to the King, and sold on his
account: but the Company would not trust the King either with their
wares or their capital<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. Foreign capitalists or governments were
then solicited in the King’s name. But the former, the Genoese for
instance, demanded securities which he could not obtain for them, as
they depended on the consent of the city of London: and the latter were
engrossed in their own affairs. Application was secretly made to the
French, and the prospect of an advantageous treaty was held out to them
as a return for an adequate loan<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>: they were told that, if only a
French ambassador were present in England, much might be effected in
their interest. It is true that at this moment the Scots were neither
supported nor even instigated by the French. But the latter were still
less inclined to help King Charles to gain an advantage over Scotland.
And what could possibly have been expected from the Spanish monarchy,
which just at that time was plunged into the greatest difficulties?
Whilst Charles was quarrelling with his subjects, the French had gained
the mastery over the Spaniards: this was one of the years which decided
the ascendancy of the former power on the Continent. But if there were
no pecuniary resources available, in what manner could such an army as
was required have been created? This deficiency was the reason why the
Earl of Northumberland declined the command-in-chief which the King
offered to him. The militia called out in the different counties was
guilty of acts of violence which made its presence intolerable; and
moreover it displayed an insubordination that was unparalleled. In some
places the soldiers assaulted their officers; in others they refused to
embark in the ships destined for a descent on the Scottish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1640.</span> coast: the government no longer ventured to arm them. It
was even found that the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose hierarchical
system the soldiers ought to have maintained by their weapons, was
insolently scorned and mimicked by them. In the army assembled at York
there were no doubt trustworthy officers in considerable numbers,
but the common soldiers were not of this character. Neither the Earl
of Strafford nor the King ventured to lead their troops against the
Scots, and besides, their army was too weak for a serious attack. They
could not but expect such events as those which had occurred in the
entrenchments by the river Tyne.</p>

<p>In the Privy Council misunderstandings and dissensions broke out.
Pembroke and Holland absented themselves on different pretexts, in
reality merely to avoid taking part any longer in its deliberations.</p>

<p>Things had now come to a crisis: the springs which the government had
been accustomed to set in motion lost all their elasticity. No one
would any longer concern himself about its designs and undertakings,
about what it did or left undone<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>: its commands and instructions
had no longer any hold: that free co-operation was withheld without
which a government can do nothing.</p>

<p>Not even among the Anglican clergy, whose cause the King had intended
to conduct, did any real agreement with his system exist. The majority
rejected the canons of the last Convocation. There were formal reasons
enough for such rejection, as the Convocation had continued to sit
after the dissolution of Parliament; but the substance of the canons
were still more fatal to their acceptance. It was thought dangerous for
the crown itself that the doctrine of the divine right of bishops was
laid down in them, for how easily, it was remarked, might that lead
to the assertion of a claim to independence! The oath demanded of the
clergy was refused on the ground that it was illegal and contrary to
the royal supremacy<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span>

<p>But if the clergy of the State Church were dissatisfied, what was
to be expected from the dissenting clergy and their supporters? The
Puritans hailed the inroad of the Scots and even their occupation of
Newcastle as a victory. For they thought that the King would now be
forced to convene a Parliament, and that that body would overthrow the
government, which had now drawn universal hatred upon itself, and would
restore the ancient rights and liberties of England.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>


<p>In a sense quite different from that in which James I thought to
achieve the union of the two crowns and kingdoms, was that union
destined to be accomplished; and already everything was smoothing the
way thereto. The special object of the first two Stuart kings was to
complete, on Tudor principles, the institutions of Church and State
in England, and to extend the same to Scotland. But they had thereby
awakened in the land of their birth a spirit of resistance at once
aristocratic and religious. In direct opposition to the King, the Scots
took up an attitude of ecclesiastical and political independence, which
never was paralleled in any other monarchy. The King hoped to crush the
Scottish movement by the strength of royal influence in England; but
the consequences were the very opposite, for the movement spread into
England also.</p>

<p>When the Scots entered England their first and chief demand was that
the King should settle the home affairs of Scotland; but they added two
other demands which concerned England as much as Scotland. They pressed
for the punishment of those who had caused the troubles, that is to
say, of the chosen counsellors of the King in matters both spiritual
and temporal, and also for the summoning of an English Parliament, in
which peace might be arranged.</p>

<p>They thus fully expressed the wishes of all the domestic opponents of
Charles I: no further extension of them was necessary to imply the
overthrow in England also of the political system that had hitherto
prevailed. On the question how far the King would yield depended the
future of his government, of his own life, and of the two nations.</p>

<span class="small">SUMMONING OF THE PARLIAMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It seemed to be going back to an ancient long-forgotten state of
things, when in the English Privy Council, which continued its
sittings in the King’s absence, and was anxiously discussing means
of escape from existing difficulties, the Earl of Manchester, Lord
Privy Seal, a man of great age and strong sense, though somewhat
too fond of precedent, proposed to renew at this juncture the old
institution of the Magnum Concilium, which had preceded the formation
of Parliament<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>. He recalled the times when the advice of the peers,
as the born counsellors of the King, had roused the nation to great
efforts. The objection was urged that no assembly of the kind had taken
place for fully three hundred years: moreover that it would merely be
leading indirectly to what the Scots had demanded, the summoning of a
Parliament. Archbishop Laud did not like the prospect, but, considering
the probable results of calling a Parliament, declared for the assembly
of peers. The King without hesitation accepted the proposal, and on
September 7 issued writs, whereby he summoned the Peers of the realm
to York, ‘to take counsel with them about weighty and serious matters
touching the condition of the kingdom.’</p>

<p>The nation however was not satisfied; and the first cry for the
immediate convocation of a Parliament arose from among the nobility
themselves.</p>

<p>The government was somewhat alarmed to find that without their previous
knowledge a considerable number of peers about this time assembled in
London, most of whom were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> known to be bitterly
hostile to the existing régime. There were the Earls of Bedford and
Hertford, whose forefathers had won their fame by the share they had
taken in forwarding the thorough reformation of the Church (what had
become of the bishops, if the ideas of Protector Somerset, the ancestor
of Hertford, had maintained their ground?): there were Essex, Warwick,
the brother of Holland, who fully agreed with them in general political
sentiments, Lord Mandeville, the son of Manchester, but belonging to a
totally different party from his father, Say and Brooke, who had been
the first to show that their views were opposed to the King. After a
short consultation they agreed on a petition, in which they repeated
the general grievances of the last session of Parliament, and with
special emphasis insisted on those which had first come to light since
then, such as the newly imposed oath<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. They laid great stress on
the dangers arising from the military preparations. The recusants, said
they, are forbidden by law even to have weapons in their houses, and
now high commands in the army are entrusted to them: what misfortunes
would happen if any Irish troops were brought over to England—a fear
which had seized on men’s minds in consequence of the known views of
Strafford, long before his expressions had been thus interpreted. The
Lords declared that there was only one remedy for all these evils,
namely the immediate assembly of Parliament, which was necessary in
order to remove the grievances of the people, to punish the originators
of them for their several offences, to end the war without bloodshed,
and to unite the two kingdoms against the common enemy of religion. It
will be seen that these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> Lords, who had been
named to the Scots as guarantees that they would meet a favourable
reception in England, now, as might be expected, urged as their own the
chief demands of the Scots.</p>

<p>On the very day on which Charles I issued his summons for the Magnum
Concilium to meet at York, the two Earls of Bedford and Hertford
appeared in London before the Privy Council, laid their petition before
it, and moved for its concurrence in their prayer. The Earls said that
they themselves were ready to pay true obedience to the King under
all circumstances, but that they could not answer for the friends by
whom they were commissioned, and that if their request was rejected,
they would not be held answerable for the mischiefs that might
ensue<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. The obvious question was asked, who were their associates:
and they replied, many other lords and a great part of the gentry
in all parts of the country. The news of the summoning of the Great
Council was communicated to them: they received it without attaching
much importance to the fact, remarking that this council durst not
take any steps towards the granting of money, nor allow any injury to
the commons and their rights. Lord Arundel referred to the religious
portion of their petition, saying that they seemed to wish to join the
Scots for the purpose of effecting a reform in the Church<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>, but
that the result might be, under the pretext of liberty and religion to
make England a prey to the Scots. The two Earls were asked if there was
not already in England an association similar to the Covenant: but this
they denied.</p>

<p>Without doubt such was the situation;—it is true that no popular
religious union, either in England itself, or with the Scots, was
actually formed: still that did not prevent the Scottish cause from
being sure of general sympathy. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> saw in
it the cause of God and of the only true religion, which the Scottish
army had come to defend: others cared chiefly for the support which
the presence of the Scots afforded to their own political attitude: in
many both these motives for sympathy were united. From the beginning
down to the present day, the exact understanding which had been
entered into between the parties has continued in the profoundest
obscurity. Tradition connects the memory of it, among other places,
with Broughton Castle in Oxfordshire, the seat of Lord Say, and Fawley
in Northamptonshire, the house of a son-in-law of John Hampden: there
a table was pointed out, at which all the plans were concocted from
which the civil troubles arose. In London it was at the house of John
Pym, near Gray’s Inn, that the meetings were held and conferences took
place, by which, as it was assumed, a close connexion with the Scots
was maintained<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. Moreover the well-considered and well-written
manifesto of the Scots made a marked impression in their favour: it
suggested points of view which every one could accept. They did not
omit, after the capture of Newcastle, a place which was of the utmost
importance to the English capital on account of the coal supply, to
open communications with the city: they expressed in a special letter,
as well as in their manifesto, their good-will and even their reverence
for London, assuring them that the traffic should not be for an instant
interrupted, their purpose being to make friends and not enemies. We
learn that this declaration produced the desired effect<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>.</p>

<p>After the step taken by the Lords, preparations were immediately made
in the city to present a petition similar to theirs. The Privy Council
sent a letter to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, warning them against
this proceeding; saying that the city had from the earliest times
been treated as the King’s chamber, even as his own house, to which
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> would entrust his wife and children<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>:
that they ought not to press him about grievances which he was ever
labouring to remove, and that this course was inconsistent with
the customs and charters of the city. But the Aldermen refused to
interfere: still less could they be induced to do what was suggested
to them—address to the King a petition of contrary tenour<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. These
ideas of a special connexion vanished before the general religious and
political motives of action in the Commons as well as in the Lords.
The King was requested, in the name of his capital also, to summon a
Parliament as soon as possible, for the removal of grievances to which,
as experience proved, the usual course of justice did not extend.</p>

<p>This was the demand which had been repeated for more than ten years
in stronger or weaker language, which the King had evaded as often as
possible, but which nevertheless had often been pressed upon him. Once
he had taken steps in that direction, in the hope that complications
abroad might in the interval occur to check opposition at home: but he
was most bitterly disappointed. Should he now after all decide on this
course? The need of Parliamentary aid was more pressing than ever, the
cry for a Parliament louder: and the impression which this demand had
made was deepened by another motive, the fear of worse consequences
in case of refusal. The idea gained ground that if the King delayed
to call a Parliament, the associated Lords would take steps towards
that end<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. A Parliament had already been held in Scotland without
the King’s participation. What else did the threats mean that Bedford
and Hertford had uttered before the assembled Privy Council? It was
asserted that the Queen, who was close at hand at Hampton Court, and
was taking counsel on the state of affairs with her confidants in the
Privy Council, had been induced by the impending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1640.</span> dangers to advise the King to summon Parliament immediately;
and if he would not do this—so she was reported to have written with
the concurrence of some of the ministers—that at least he should not
lose an instant in returning to London, otherwise irreparable disasters
would be imminent<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. Hereupon the King adopted the resolution which
of all others was most repugnant to him, and that immediately; no
extraneous influence could have led him to it. The time-honoured course
of constitutional deliberation appeared under the circumstances to
promise the best results: people flattered themselves that the Earl of
Strafford would exhibit his parliamentary talents in England also. That
nothing might interfere with his presence in the English Parliament,
the Irish, in which he was equally necessary, was prorogued to Easter.
The English Parliament was to be held as early as possible: the opening
was fixed for Nov. 3.</p>

<p>With this declaration the King met the peers when they gathered round
him at York in the latter half of September: the great question had
already been decided without them. Charles I claimed their assistance
in two other matters which, though secondary to this, were in
themselves of great consequence—to bring about an accommodation with
the Scots, and (inasmuch as until this could be effected the royal army
must be held together, without any Parliamentary grant being made for
its maintenance) to procure him the means of keeping the army for a
time in an efficient state.</p>

<p>The latter of these two points was the most pressing. There was a
talk of compulsory loans after the fashion of the old benevolences:
some of those present declared themselves ready to make considerable
efforts of that kind: but at last they came back to the idea of trying
to get a loan in the capital. Lord Bristol observed that, as the
previous proposal for one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> had been rejected
through political misgivings, since removed through the issue of writs
for a Parliament, they might now reckon on acceptance. Six of the
peers, among whom we find Pembroke and Manchester, in the name of the
remainder repaired to the city on this errand. After they had conferred
with the Lord Mayor and aldermen, a meeting was held on October 2,
not of the entire civic body, a thing which was purposely avoided,
but of the full common council. It had been rumoured in the city that
their last petition had been badly received by the King: the Lords
contradicted this report, and declared themselves fully satisfied with
the behaviour and with the latest resolves of the King. The objection
was urged that they could not grant to the Lords what had been refused
to the King, but they produced a letter from the King in which he
expressed his full assent to this course. The necessity for keeping
on foot the royal army was shown by the violence of which the Scots
had been guilty in the northern counties. The Bishop of Durham, who
had suffered most at their hands, was present to give information on
the subject. After the Lords had retired their request was assented
to<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. So much trouble did it cost to obtain a loan of £200,000, the
repayment of which was to depend on the grants of Parliament, but was
further secured to the city by the guarantee of the Lords.</p>

<p>It remained to make some arrangement with the Scots. For this purpose
the most favourably disposed of the lords, especially the signers
of the address, were despatched to Ripon. Men like Strafford could
desire nothing more than that the affair should reach this stage:
they were always hoping that a complete knowledge of the intentions
and demands of the Scots would induce all old-fashioned Englishmen to
combine against them. All actual negotiation was however stopped by
the question of money: the Scots required that their army should be
maintained at the cost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> of England. On this
account they asked so large a sum, £40,000 a month, that the lords
who had been deputed to meet them thought it necessary to refer the
matter back to the great council of peers at York. By this council
the subject was debated at length on October 6. Among others, Lord
Herbert of Cherbury, the historian of Henry VIII, declared himself
emphatically against the demand, saying that he had read now and then
of buying treaties of peace, but never of buying negotiations, the
result of which was still as it were in the air. Others declared it to
be an inevitable necessity: they must either drive the Scots back, or
grant their demands in full. The first course Strafford himself deemed
impossible; he pledged himself to defend Yorkshire against them, but
not Westmoreland and Cumberland<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. Could they abandon these two
counties to be occupied by the Scots, and probably plundered as well,
together with those already in their hands? It had been said that the
Scottish army might be reduced, and then supplied out of Scotland: but
in order to attain this they must first defeat it, and for this must
before all things be unanimous. It was determined at last to guarantee
to the Scots for the future the sum (£850) which they exacted daily
from the occupied districts, this money to be raised at once from the
neighbouring counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland, with the promise
that Parliament would make good to them whatever they might do for
the safety of the kingdom. On these terms a truce was signed with the
Scots. They stayed in England, and thus the very extraordinary result
followed, that two armies which had been intended to fight each other,
remained facing each other with their swords sheathed, both at the cost
of the same authority. That both armies thus depended on the grants of
Parliament rendered that body absolutely indispensable, and gave it a
necessary strength sufficient to overrule the King’s will.</p>

<p>In general terms it may be said that the summoning of Parliament
implied the defeat of the King. His system of alliance between the
crown and the hierarchy was thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> virtually
overthrown. Between the ideas of the Scottish spiritual and temporal
assemblies which he combated, and the tendencies which had caused
him to dissolve the last English Parliament, as well as previous
ones, a league was formed which thenceforth held the upper hand, and
threatened to dictate the law to him. The question was merely how far
the restrictions would extend, to which he must undoubtedly submit, and
what changes in the State would be attempted in consequence.</p>

<p>In the elections which now began preference was given in general to
those who had most zealously opposed the existing authorities, or
were known as the most ardent Protestants. There were no such boards
in London as in Edinburgh, formed on purpose to manage elections
systematically. But those who were of one mind were seen to hasten
from county to county, in order to exert their influence in each to
the utmost. On the side of the government also a list was prepared:
the King claimed the aid of the chief lords in his service, such as
Pembroke, in support of his candidates in the boroughs: and some names
show that this attempt was not altogether fruitless. But the efforts of
the popular party were by far the most successful<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. Of the members
of the last Parliament three-fifths—294 out of 493—were re-elected.
Moreover the new members belonged almost entirely to the popular party.
Of those who had already won a reputation on this side, not one failed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="small">THE FIRST SITTINGS OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On the morning of November 3, 1640, the Lord Steward appeared in the
vestibule of St. Stephen’s chapel, which since the Reformation had
served as the place of meeting for the Lower House. The clerk of
the crown called over the names of the members, who took the oaths
of allegiance and supremacy at the hands of the Lord Steward or his
deputies appointed for the purpose. An hour after midday the King, who
had come in a barge from Whitehall, landed close to Westminster bridge.
After hearing a sermon in the Abbey, he opened Parliament with a speech
in the House of Lords, which the Commons attended. When the latter
had returned to their own house, and taken their seats, the Treasurer
of the King’s household nominated as Speaker a young barrister, named
William Lenthall. He was accepted with general acclamation, and then
conducted by the Treasurer and one of the secretaries to his chair,
a few feet in front of the chapel window, opposite the places of
the members, which rose in two ranks one behind the other<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. The
government had at an earlier period thought of designating as Speaker
one of their own supporters, but in spite of all their efforts had
failed to secure his election. It may be assumed that the hearty
reception accorded to the new Speaker did not so much apply to him,
since he was as yet little known, as express a sense of the advantage
gained through the rejection of the other.</p>

<p>It was remarked with displeasure and dissatisfaction that the King
came to the opening of Parliament, not with the pomp of a splendid
cavalcade, but in a plain barge, just as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span>
a session were being opened after a prorogation<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>, and in fact
this corresponded with his feelings and language. He referred in his
speech to the previous Parliament, and now as then entered immediately
on the questions of the Scottish war, and the redress of grievances.
The difference however between the two occasions was most marked and
complete. The King no longer claimed precedence for the question of
supplies for the war: he left it to Parliament to decide which of
the two subjects it would take up first. But it was his wish and
hope to direct their attention before everything to getting rid of
the Scots from English territory: for the pressure which weighed on
the northern counties, the welfare and honour of the whole country,
rendered this absolutely necessary. To the same effect spoke the
Lord Keeper Finch; he brought vividly forward the innovations of the
Scots, which were opposed to the fundamental laws of the realm, and
to monarchical institutions. As it had excited some remark that the
King had directly called the Scots rebels, he deemed it advisable,
a couple of days later, to explain himself in a second speech<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>,
without however withdrawing what he had said. On this second occasion
he expressed again his expectation that the Lords would help him to
bring his Scottish subjects to reason—for such in any case they were,
though rebels so long as they were in England—and to send them back
into their own country, whether they would or no. The Lords seemed to
assent to this. The Scottish commissioners had come to London, and
a conference between the Lords and the Lower House would shortly be
necessary, in order, as they requested, to settle in Parliament terms
of accommodation with them. After a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> days
the Lords actually proposed such a conference, but the Commons declared
that they were at present too busy with other weighty matters.</p>

<p>Among the latter the King roused at once the liveliest opposition when
he urged in harsh language the removal of the Scots. It was through
the attitude of the Commons in the last Parliament that the expedition
of the Scots had been undertaken. The whole course of events, the
convocation of another Parliament, originated in the advance of the
Scots into England. How could the Lower House, which held the Scottish
cause to be its own, have declared against them?</p>

<p>Without paying any attention to the King’s wish to undertake or to
decide on some measure against the Scots, the Commons, as soon as they
had despatched the first formal business, began the discussion of
grievances, with the intention not merely of removing them, but also of
punishing their authors. The first sitting in which this took place,
that of November 7, is specially remarkable for the feelings then
exhibited.</p>

<p>First, John Hampden submitted a complaint about the cruelties which
had been perpetrated in consequence of a refusal to pay ship-money,
for which he made the Lord Chief Justice and Judges of the King’s
Bench answerable. Next was mentioned the far grosser ill-treatment
which Bastwick and Burton had suffered at the hands of the spiritual
tribunal. The reply which the King’s servants made, that this was a
matter of State, in which they must first enquire of the King, was met
by a reminder that the King had already given them leave to enquire
into abuses. It was resolved that Burton and Bastwick should be
summoned before Parliament to plead their own cause. Then the member
for Hertford presented a petition from that county, in which the chief
grievances that had come before the last Parliament were repeated.
The county prayed not merely for the removal of them, but for the
discovery and punishment of their authors. Harbottle Grimstone, member
for Colchester, who had once expiated in prison his resistance to a
loan for Charles I, called to remembrance the disappointments which had
befallen the members of the last Parliament.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span>
‘But what good,’ cried he, ‘have our complaints or our petitions ever
done? The judges have overthrown the law, and the bishops religion.’
The same tone was adopted by men of generally moderate opinions.
Benjamin Rudyard inveighed against the King’s counsellors, who, while
they talked of his service, really sought nothing but their own
interest; who by their conduct caused confusion, and then used that
very confusion as a pretext for measures seven times worse than the
previous ones. Francis Seymour, the brother of Hertford, added that
no man could any longer endure the present state of things, without
being false to the duty which he owed not merely to the King but also
to his country. The assembly had thus been brought into such a state
of violent agitation coupled with self-confidence, as might naturally
result from the knowledge of having suffered wrongs, and of being in a
position to terminate them, when John Pym, who had already spoken once,
rose for the second time to make a general reply.</p>

<p>John Pym belonged to the school of Coke and Cotton, which desired to
see the parliamentary rights that had been won in Plantagenet times
re-established in England. In previous Parliaments he had appeared
as one of the leading opponents of monopolies, and other exercises
of prerogative. James I had remarked with dislike his imperious and
unyielding spirit. Moreover he like others was actuated by Calvinistic
zeal for that exclusive Protestantism which he regarded as the only
form of religion tolerated by law in England. He had at all times
contended not only against financial extortion, but also against the
favour which Catholic tendencies found, and had more than once had to
encounter the King’s vengeance in consequence. When Parliaments were
no more held, and judicial decisions legalised ship-money, the hope of
accomplishing any good in England seems to have failed in him as in
others: we find his name among those who were directing their gaze to
the shores beyond the Atlantic, and the colonies to be planted there.
It does not appear certain whether he or his friends had actually
formed the purpose of emigrating; but there is no doubt that he, and
other like-minded members of the nobility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> and
gentry, took part in the commercial intercourse with Providence, and
had acquired possessions in Massachusetts. George Fenwick, the agent
of Lords Say and Brooke, for a long time would allow no settlement
in their districts; he kept them vacant for the owners, who might
at any moment be expected to arrive<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. Then came the troubles in
Scotland. The same sentiments which drove Winthrop and his friends to
America, now kept Pym and his associates in England. The former gave
way when the ecclesiastical tyranny of Laud became unendurable to
them: the latter, when the first commotion began, seized on the hope
of freeing England also from it. The ideas of the Scots were of a very
similar type: rigid Calvinism in doctrine pervaded all, together with
demands for independence in the Church, and a political constitution
which should secure this. The English and Scottish movements and the
emigration to America sprang from one and the same source. Among
those who promoted the union between England and Scotland John Pym
stands foremost. Through him above all men it came to pass that the
Parliament of the spring of 1640, instead of voting subsidies against
Scotland, brought into prominent notice the English grievances of like
character. Thereupon followed the rising in arms of the Scots, and a
general ferment in England. John Pym instigated the popular petitions
demanding a Parliament: he prepared and directed the elections: he
was in fact often pointed out as the author of this Parliament. At
all times a declared enemy of Spain, he had no objection to enter
into alliance with the French, whose interests were identical with
those of England<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. His peculiar talent lay in combining opposites,
and directing towards one end movements which were remote from one
another. Pym was no rigorous Puritan: he loved cheerful conviviality:
occasionally, in street ballads or violent lampoons, he is accused of
irregularities of conduct. But from the time when he reached the point
which made political influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> possible for
him, he gave his whole heart to the task he had set himself. Personal
considerations swayed him not; the interests of his family were of no
weight with him; he died in debt: from earliest dawn till late into
the night he laboured for his end. Other men could but follow him, or
hate him from the bottom of their hearts<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. Through the force of
the ideas of which he was the champion, he is for all time a man of
great historical importance: through the zeal and good fortune with
which he acted, he gained an unique political position. He was the
representative of the opposition in the old Parliament, and of the
alliance with the Scots which characterised the new. He could reckon on
producing a great impression by every word he spoke.</p>

<p>In parliamentary assemblies the most influential speeches will be, not
those which approach most nearly to the ideal of classical eloquence,
but those which best correspond to the education and mental tendencies
prevalent at the time. Pym’s speeches, as has been observed, move
in the fetters of scholastic distinctions: but that was the form in
which men of that epoch were wont to think, in consequence of the
style and method of teaching then in vogue. They are solid, energetic,
and altogether calculated to win acceptance for the conclusions to
which they point. On this occasion he entered in more detail than
before into the source and nature of the evils from which England
was suffering. He attributed them to the violence of the spiritual
and perversion of the temporal courts, above all to the contempt
for the privileges of Parliament and the favour shown to Papists,
even in military employment. He illustrated each of his positions by
quoting piquant, pertinent, and sensational particulars, in order to
support the conclusion that a plan had been formed for altering and
destroying piecemeal, not merely the established religion, but also the
constitutional form of government. This, he said, was not only treason,
but the greatest of all imaginable treasons: it touched alike the King
and the kingdom<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> To direct the general
zeal towards the discovery and punishment of the authors of these
treasons and their accomplices was the special object of his words, and
he attained it fully.</p>

<p>The majority of the Lower House besides was strongly inclined to
exclusiveness. They would endure no one in the House who had shared in
the exaction of the last imposts, no monopolist, no projector, above
all no one who was prevented by his creed from joining in the Eucharist
according to the Anglican ritual. The Lower House could not be regarded
as an assembly of lawgivers who intended to establish the principles
of equal justice for all: their hostility to the royal prerogative led
them rather to endeavour to renew, with other laws, those statutes
against the Catholics which had been passed in the hottest times of the
religious contest. All breaches of positive law, according to their
understanding of it, they were resolved to punish as offences, without
any regard to royal prerogative. Everything breathed a decidedly
aggressive spirit. In parliamentary meetings of the leading members
this course was systematically planned, and the resolution taken that
the Lower House should act as a sort of high court of enquiry for the
kingdom. While it was thought expedient to combine all grounds of
complaint in one great remonstrance, it was generally agreed to spare
the King, to ignore his personal share, and always to mention his
name with respect<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>. All the blame was to be cast on his advisers.
They went through the list of men who had most participated in the
misgovernment, in the Privy Council, on the episcopal and judicial
benches, finding many who might be held criminally responsible, and
ending with the special confidential advisers of the King, the junta
by which affairs had been managed hitherto, and against which both
kingdoms had common grounds of complaint. Hence one of the hardest
and weightiest questions of parliamentary life came again to the
front. When James I and Charles raised their favourites to the highest
posts, so that men who were their mere personal dependants wielded
the whole power of the State, we have seen already how often and how
zealously both Lords and Commons resisted such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span>
inclinations. Charles I was always extremely sensitive on this point:
more than once parliaments were dissolved because they harped on this
topic. For a long time Charles I had ceased to have any personal
favourites, but the leading members of his government identified
themselves with his absolutist and anti-parliamentary policy. It must
be left undecided whether the schemes of the administration originated
chiefly with the King or his ministers: they were agreed in the idea
of a government to be carried on essentially through prerogative. This
intimate connexion between the royal authority and the holders of
administrative power decided the leaders of the Parliament to begin
operations by an attack on the ministers. Not that they were convinced
that the ministers had in fact acted independently of the King, and
merely covered with his name their own wills and purposes; but a few
great examples would re-establish the right which Parliament had
enjoyed in early centuries, and sometimes exercised in later times,
to bring men of the highest position before its tribunal, to subject
the administration to its control, and render it responsible. On this
very ground King Charles had avoided convoking parliaments, because he
feared the reappearance of this demand, which touched the very sources
of his power, the means by which the general direction of affairs
devolve on the crown. Now however in the course of events a Parliament
was assembled in which his opponents had the upper hand: what was to
prevent a return to the policy of earlier Parliaments? No one as yet
entertained, at any rate consciously, the purpose of overthrowing the
monarchy; but it was intended to confine its operations within narrow
limits, and to ensure the preponderance of the parliamentary over the
royal authority. They wished too to destroy the ministers, to take
vengeance on those whom they had hitherto been compelled to fear, from
whom they had suffered personal wrongs: it was now the ministers’ turn
to experience a reverse of fortune, and feel the power of their enemies.</p>

<p>No one was better qualified to lead the attack than John Pym, who had
himself announced it in the above-mentioned speech. As in former years
he had contended against Cranfield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640.</span> at the side
of Buckingham, then against the latter himself, so too it was well
remembered, at least by members of Parliament, with what effect he had
battled against Montague and Manwaring<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>At the time that Wentworth deserted the popular party, Pym is said to
have told him that he was going headlong to destruction. This was the
man who now for a long time had most thoroughly personified royalist
tendencies: on him the first and decisive attack must be made. Pym had
for some time been preparing to bring about the fulfilment of his own
prediction. When therefore, at the beginning of the appointment of
committees, Pym proposed that the affairs of Ireland should be debated
in a committee of the whole house, every one saw what his object was.
The friends of the Viceroy demanded a separate committee. But the
majority on which Pym could reckon when it came to actual impeachment,
were on his side in the preliminary question also: by a trifling
majority, but still in legal form, the resolution was adopted that the
whole house should form the committee on Irish affairs.</p>

<p>It has always excited surprise that Wentworth Earl of Strafford
appeared in Parliament at all. For even if he could have deceived
himself so far as not to believe that impeachment and danger to
his life awaited him, yet obviously he would have been much safer
with the army, or in Ireland, or abroad. It has been said that he
represented the whole case to the King<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>, but that the latter, who
still thought himself strong enough to protect his friends under all
circumstances, reassured him, and requested his presence on the ground
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640</span> he could not dispense with his advice. We
need not however believe that Strafford trusted to this assurance. He
knew full well, and avowed the knowledge, that there was a necessity
which overruled the King’s good-will, for owing to the presence of the
Scottish army he was in a measure at the mercy of the Puritans. But
his friends implored him to come, in order to prevent blunders and
follies such as had already been committed. Very unwillingly he tore
himself away from Wodehouse, his country seat: but he desired to obey
the King’s wish, and not to be untrue to his party. Moreover he had
some confidence in his cause: it is asserted that he had in his hands
proofs of an alliance between his enemies and the Scots which could
be construed as treason, and that he intended to found thereon an
impeachment against them.</p>

<p>Accusation against accusation: but the one depended on the notions
of old English loyalty; the other had as its motive and aim the idea
of parliamentary government: the former treated as high treason the
alliance with the Scots, the latter the war against them. Their
opposition corresponded to that between the chief combatants, and the
principles embraced by each. Had the King obtained the upper hand in
the field, perhaps the first might have prevailed: but after he had
sustained a political defeat, the success of the second became more
probable.</p>

<p>Strafford came to London on November 10, and that evening had an
audience at Whitehall: next morning he appeared in the Upper House
to take his seat, and then repaired again to Whitehall. There he was
informed that the Commons were busy with an impeachment against him: he
replied that he would look his enemies in the face. On this morning,
the 11th, the chamber in which the Commons assembled was closed and
the key laid on the table, in order that no one might absent himself,
and no stranger might come into the house. All other business was set
aside, in order that the house might devote itself to the impeachment
of Strafford. A committee of seven members, among whom were Pym
and Hampden, was deputed to draw it up: after their draft had been
approved, Pym himself was appointed to carry it to the Upper House. At
the head of about three hundred members he appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1640</span> before them: ‘My Lords,’ said he, ‘in the name of the Commons of
Parliament and of the country I impeach Thomas Earl of Strafford, Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, of high treason. I am commissioned to request
that he be removed from Parliament and committed to prison.’ The Lords
had come to no conclusion when Strafford, with haughty and lowering
demeanour, entered the house and went towards his seat. In the morning
he had been received by every one with respect, now a hollow murmur
greeted him. He might have intended to take part in the debate, and so
have the opportunity of at once taking his own line, but he was obliged
to retire into the antechamber until a resolution was taken respecting
him. The Upper House could not well do otherwise than assent to the
request of the Commons. The Viceroy, who in the morning was regarded
by most men as lord and master of the executive power of England,
was seen in the afternoon to kneel at the bar of the Upper House,
and in obedience to the commands which he there received, follow the
gentleman-usher to his house as a prisoner<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.</p>

<p>Prosecution was now of necessity directed also against the man whom the
English and Scottish Puritans regarded as the source of those torrents
of destruction which had overflowed the Church, Archbishop Laud. On
December 18 an impeachment for high treason against him was laid before
the Upper House, and his arrest ordered. Rising from prayer in his
chapel, he entered the barge which was to carry him to the Tower: he
was confident of so defending himself before Parliament as to make the
justice of his cause obvious; but had this been more irreproachable
than it was, he had as little chance of making it prevail, before a
Parliament such as was then assembled, as the Puritans had had before
his own spiritual tribunals.</p>

<p>Inferior in external dignity, but not less important in fact, was the
office of Secretary Windebank, who, as his letters show, exercised much
influence over the King, and enjoyed the confidence of the Queen: he
was not only favourable to Spain, like Strafford, but also inclined
towards Catholicism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1640</span> The chief articles of an
impeachment against him were already drawn up. His impending arrest
was a danger not merely to himself, but to all who were associated
with him: it was feared that in the proceedings against Strafford and
Laud he would be compelled to give evidence which would destroy them
utterly. With one of his subordinates who knew as much as himself, he
avoided arrest by flight into France: he had a pass from the King<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.
The French minister hastened to warn his government against him, as a
very suspicious person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the impeachment against John Lord Finch had been prepared
by examination of the judges, over whom he had exercised illegitimate
influence in the matter of ship-money. His friends prevailed so far
that he was first heard once more in his defence. Quitting the woolsack
in the Upper House, in his official dress, the great seal of the
kingdom, with the bag which held it, in his hand, he appeared before
the Commons. The excuses which he alleged were not positively false:
moreover he was able to plead some attempts to defend and shelter the
preachers. These actions, the beauty and eloquence of his language,
and his tone of submission, won him a certain amount of sympathy.
Nevertheless impeachment and imprisonment would undoubtedly have been
his lot, had not his friends succeeded in interposing sufficient delay
to allow of his also taking to flight. He sent the great seal secretly
to the king, and took ship for Holland<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the men to whose hands had been committed all the chief offices of
state in the army, the Church, the law, foreign affairs, were banished
or imprisoned: in one way or another Parliament proceeded further to
make sure of the most interested judges, the most confidential friends
of Strafford, the most active bishops. All those who had taken a
consenting and active part in the government saw themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1640</span> personally threatened. Not only a change of persons, but an
alteration of the mode of government had to be achieved: there was a
complete and systematic revolution of principles. It was now definitely
established that Parliamentary privilege was the fundamental law of
the realm, and that every infringement of it, although with the King’s
approval, should be punished as a crime. Henceforth there was a change
in the power, an offence against which constituted high treason:
formerly it was the King, now it was the entire Parliamentary body. In
their hands was the sword of vengeance: the victims of the Star Chamber
were set free, the members of the tribunal impeached.</p>

<p>Sundry resolutions corresponding to this idea were adopted by
Parliament; for instance, in relation to ship-money<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, which was
declared contrary to the laws of the realm, to the private rights of
subjects, and to previous statutes. Care was taken to restore to those
who had paid them the last raised contributions, which were still
in the hands of the sheriffs. This gave the bench of judges greater
security against arbitrary dismissal. But as the chief source of the
evil was seen to lie in the long intermission of Parliaments and
their abrupt dissolution, the most special care was directed towards
making this impossible. The general feeling was that they could never
long reckon on the good behaviour of the ministers unless the rod
of responsibility was always hung over them, that otherwise their
arbitrary power would in a short time grow again like Samson’s hair,
and that the only means of keeping good ministers lay in the frequent
repetition of Parliaments<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. Demands similar to those of which the
Scots had set the example, were made in England also, that Parliament
should meet every three years. Neither the power to convoke nor the
power to dissolve it was to be left entirely to the King’s pleasure.
It was resolved that if the King had not summoned a Parliament before
September 3 of the third year, the peers of the realm were to issue
the necessary writs in the King’s name: should they prove dilatory,
the sheriffs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> counties and mayors of the
towns were to order the elections: and in case even these did nothing,
the burgesses and freeholders might come to the poll unsummoned. On the
same principle Parliament was neither to be dissolved nor prorogued
until the session had lasted fifty days, without the assent of both
Houses.</p>

<p>These proposed enactments met with some opposition from the Lords: but
as they involved interests common to both Houses, they passed that
House also. We are assured that the King was fully sensible of the
injurious effect which these measures must have on himself<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>: he
foresaw that the censorship to which his ministers and himself would be
subjected every three years must destroy the freedom of his designs,
and limit his authority over the people. When the bill was presented
to him he showed himself extremely unwilling to accept it. But an
outspoken refusal once before had stopped all further negotiations:
moreover there was a feeling at court that it would have been better
for the King himself if his ministers had had no option in this
respect. Charles I was induced to give way on February 16; the clerk of
the Parliament was instructed to utter the old Norman formula, ‘Le roi
le veut.’</p>

<p>Among those who originally were doomed to destruction was Hamilton:
but at the crisis when the Scots penetrated into England a change
of policy was observed in him. Though formerly he had recommended
extreme measures, he was not prepared to risk his life for them. He now
recommended the King to grant the demands of the Scots, and entered
into an alliance with their leaders, his former opponents, and with the
lords of the opposition party. By his mediation the most conspicuous
of the latter, Bedford and Hertford, Essex, Mandeville, Saville, Say,
as well as Bristol, were admitted into the Privy Council, thereby
obtaining a certain share in the administration. It was generally
believed at the time that this suggestion proceeded from the Scots, who
desired to see their friends in the King’s council, in order to ensure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> the granting of their demands. The court based on
it the prospect of a better understanding with the Parliament. Hamilton
had at first some difficulty, but ultimately the King once more obeyed
the voice to which for some years he had been wont to pay special
attention<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.</p>

<p>On the whole we may suppose that the King under this influence
cherished the idea of conducting a Parliamentary government, and, since
his late ministers had fallen, of trying to work it through members
of the opposition. But circumstances were such that very little could
be achieved by means of a mere change of ministry. The restraints
imposed on the King meant far more than mere alterations in form: the
principle from which they sprang touched the vital point of his power.
And the tendencies of a totally different nature and extent which were
exhibited in the spirit both of members of Parliament and of the people
were such that no accommodation with them was possible.</p>

<span class="small">PROGRESS OF AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES IN THE LOWER HOUSE.</span></h2>

</div>

<h3 id="DEBATES"><i>Debates on Episcopacy.</i></h3>

<p>Attempts have been made to separate the good which the Long Parliament
did from the errors of which it was guilty. The former is seen in the
abolition of the excesses of the royal prerogative, the latter in
its vehement prosecution of its opponents and the attack made on the
constitution of the Church. From the point of view rendered possible
by later events such a separation has its truth: but historically
it cannot be made as regards either time or intention: the good was
inextricably mingled with the evil. If we consider the close connexion
between English and Scottish affairs, the importance of Church matters
in Scotland, and the preponderance which the same views had obtained
in England among those who were at the head of affairs or were active
in lower spheres, we shall see that, when once the united oppositions
of the two countries had won a common victory, nothing else was to be
expected but that the acts hostile to Episcopacy in Scotland would be
repeated in England. When the Scottish deputies came to London they
expected to find friends, but they found something more: they were
themselves amazed at the deference and admiration lavished on them
and their country. On the first fast-day appointed by Parliament all
the pulpits rang with praises of the Scots, who had been set apart by
God to put an end to idolatry and tyranny in the English Church. The
language of many English preachers seemed to the Scottish deputies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> very extraordinary<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>: they scorned Episcopacy
and the Liturgy, and called for a Covenant. It was probably Pym through
whom a new and increased influence was opened to public opinion, by the
introduction and authorisation of the practice of popular petitions to
Parliament. One of the first petitions for which this right was used
was also one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching that ever was
presented: it was directed against the continuance of Episcopacy in
England. It dwelt chiefly on the late violent measures of the bishops,
by which so many good and true subjects were driven into exile for
conscience’ sake; on the number of books that had been forbidden in
which true religion was taught, while many others were published by
their authority in which doctrines tending to Popery were inculcated;
on the fact that every argument on which the bench of bishops depended
was equally valid in favour of the Papacy; on the desire of all Papists
for the maintenance of their power. The conclusion was thence drawn
that the order of bishops and prelates must be destroyed totally, as
the phrase went, ‘root and branch.’ The petition was supported by
fifteen thousand signatures. Alderman Pennington said, that if a show
of hands might be taken as a sufficient sign of assent, they might
reckon fifteen times fifteen thousand supporters for it.</p>

<p>Now however arose a difficulty peculiar to England. In Scotland the
power of the Presbyterian Church had repressed every movement which
went beyond Presbyterianism: the abolition of Episcopacy in Scotland
was exclusively its work. In England Presbyterianism was neither
established nor yet the only prevalent creed among the enemies of
Episcopacy. Many other separatist sects had sprung up in mysterious
darkness, and, as soon as Laud’s hand was withdrawn, suddenly emerged
into daylight—Brownists, Independents, Formalists, Adamites,
Anabaptists, all sorts of names, differing in most respects, but all
agreed in one, that the union of ecclesiastical and political power,
as it had hitherto existed in England, must come to an end. In the
signatures to the petition these sects had as great a share as the
Presbyterians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span>

<p>It was never for a moment lost sight of that there existed between
them and the Presbyterians a deeply-rooted difference of opinion.
Lords Say and Brooke, and some conspicuous members of the Lower House
who belonged to the one party, agreed with the leaders of the other
to make common cause against the common enemy, to work together for
the overthrow of the episcopal establishment, so as first to clear
the ground, and then to see about erecting a new edifice<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.
It was understood that when it came to setting up a Presbyterian
establishment, toleration was to be granted to the separatists<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>.
As two powers which are making joint preparations for war are wont to
agree beforehand on the arrangements that are to be made after the
victory, so these two religious parties came to an agreement on the
relations which were to subsist between them after the fall of their
common enemy. They already contemplated a great Church conference which
should then be held.</p>

<p>United they had the multitude entirely on their side. Those who had
been persecuted or exiled by Laud were conducted back into the city
with endless rejoicings. Bastwick was met by a thousand horsemen:
wherever he passed he was greeted by triumphant trumpet-blasts. His
return was a victory over the hated power of the bishops and the
spiritual courts, which men now hoped to destroy for ever.</p>

<p>This scheme, regarded from the historical point of view, appears
totally subversive of both Church and State in England. For there was
this difference between England and the other Protestant countries,
that she alone retained Episcopacy with its claims to apostolic
succession. A movement in the episcopal order had, as we have shown,
if not actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> caused the Reformation, at
any rate effectually promoted it. Consequently England had remained
much nearer not merely to the ecclesiastical institutions, but
also to the general conditions of the middle ages, than the other
Protestant countries. In them the change was made in open war with the
prelates: in Germany, through an alliance of the lower clergy with the
territorial authorities, which were invested with power enough for
the purpose throughout the empire; in Switzerland by the independent
action of the people at large: this in Scotland had gone so far as to
frame a new ecclesiastical establishment. Just as the Stuart kings, in
attempting to reduce the Scottish Church under the dominion of bishops,
were running counter to its historical principles, so the attempt
to destroy Episcopacy in England was an attack on the recognised
foundations of the Anglican Church. There might be more justification
for those who were induced by political considerations to attempt to
set aside the bishops: for in England as elsewhere the alliance of
Episcopacy with the crown had undoubtedly gone too far in the way of
strengthening the royal authority: but when it came to overthrowing
and annihilating Episcopacy altogether, or even to destroying its
hold on the constitution and the country, the very bases of English
society were assailed. Pym certainly thought that, since Parliament
had formerly demolished monastic institutions, it was within its
authority to treat Episcopacy in the same fashion. The objection was
that the dissolution of the monasteries had not destroyed one of the
chief branches of the legislative authority, and that the prelates at
the time of the Reformation had co-operated heartily with Parliament,
and though once in danger had been saved by the fact of their intimate
connexion with the entire constitution of the country. Obviously this
would be materially affected by their removal, and the preponderance of
the Lower House finally secured, for what opposition could the Upper
House without the bishops offer to its measures?</p>

<p>There were two distinct views as to the changes which ought to be
undertaken in relation to prelacy. In January, 1641, the English clergy
of Presbyterian sentiments, seven hundred in number, placed beside
the root and branch petition one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> their
own, which aimed not at the abolition but at a reform of the English
episcopate. They desired to confine the bishops to their spiritual
functions, and further to limit these, especially in respect to
ordination and ecclesiastical censure, and to deprive them of a part
of their revenues, and of their influence in the State, namely, their
seat and voice in Parliament. In reference to the constitution of the
legislative authority in the realm, there was no difference between the
two programmes: but the latter did not interfere so fundamentally with
the conditions of daily life. The relegation of the episcopate to its
original functions was sure to meet with wider assent than its entire
abolition.</p>

<p>Among the existing committees was one for ecclesiastical affairs: the
first debate of the Lower House on this subject (Feb. 9) was on the
question whether the two petitions, or only one of them, should be
referred for consideration to this committee. The most conspicuous
speakers were Lord Digby and Nathaniel Fiennes.</p>

<p>Digby remarked, that any one who looked merely at the abuses might very
likely be disposed to cry out with the fifteen thousand petitioners,
‘Down with the bishops!’ but that in the great council of the nation
men ought not to be thus swayed by passion. He recalled the services
which the episcopal order had rendered since the Reformation, and
the good repute which it enjoyed abroad even among the Protestants,
as he had himself often observed. To try to establish in England a
Presbyterian system would be a rash, an impracticable, an Utopian
undertaking. He repeated what the King had already openly declared,
that he could never assent to the abolition of Episcopacy, with the
addition that the crown could not possibly spare the bishops. This was
of course a reason why its opponents should not tolerate it. Fiennes
rejected Episcopacy chiefly because its jurisdiction was opposed to the
secular courts, and its natural policy hostile to that of Parliament.
The sees and chapters with their dependencies he likened to old trees
in a forest, which by their roots and wide-spreading branches prevent
the young growth from coming up: if they are felled and uprooted the
young trees will obtain fresh air, and there will be valuable timber
also for the church and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> kingdom. For already
the idea was gaining favour of using the spiritual revenues to defray
both earlier expenses and also those still being incurred for the
maintenance of the two armies. Fiennes however met with considerable
opposition. After the matter had been debated a whole day the vote
seemed likely to go against him. Meanwhile however the question had
been eagerly discussed in the city: although here both views found
supporters, yet public opinion, as Baillie observed, was in favour of
Episcopacy being rooted out totally and entirely. The petitioners were
not going to be defeated at the first step. Next day they mustered
at Westminster some two thousand strong, to lend support to their
suit, as they said. And so great was the impression in fact produced
by this demonstration, that a majority of about thirty-five declared
for the reference of both petitions to the committee, which was at
the same time completed in a corresponding manner, Nathaniel Fiennes
and the younger Vane being added to it. Of the proceedings of the
committee unfortunately but few fragments are preserved to us; by
way of specimen, the questions about the authority claimed by the
bishops were discussed with much ecclesiastical learning. Selden in
particular, who already enjoyed a great reputation, defended Episcopacy
with great earnestness and success. The committee however did not
decide in favour of abolishing the constitution itself, conformably
to the London petition. On the other hand, the views of the preachers
found much favour: not only was it resolved that the exclusion of the
bishops from temporal affairs was advisable, but their authority in
certain spiritual functions was disputed, and the retention of the
rich revenues of the chapters called in question<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. On March 9 the
committee reported to the Lower House to this effect. In conformity
with the report the House two days later passed a resolution that
the legislative and judicial authority of the bishops in the House
of Peers, as well as their participation in temporal courts, was a
hindrance to the discharge of their spiritual duties and generally
injurious to the commonwealth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> and that these
powers might and should be taken from them by bill<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. We see the
wide scope of this resolution, which severely shook one of the chief
foundations of the English constitutional edifice, as it had been
framed in the course of centuries; it corresponded to the political
tendencies of the time, but yet in contrast to the popular views of the
day appeared altogether too moderate. The city mob, which saw itself
checked in its course, was little contented therewith. The Scots saw
in the resolution only a beginning of the good work: at present, said
they, you are stripping off the roof, another time you will pull down
the walls. They did not hesitate to address to the Upper House, before
which the matter was now to come, a document drawn up by Henderson, in
which they declared against Episcopacy altogether.</p>

<p>In the same paper the other affair was also referred to, which the
Upper House had before it, and which was soon to concentrate on itself
the almost exclusive attention of all men.</p>


<h3 id="PROCEEDINGS"><i>The Proceedings against Strafford.</i></h3>

<p>The Commons had impeached the Viceroy of Ireland for high treason
because he had attempted to overthrow the fundamental laws of England
and to introduce arbitrary government. On January 30 they laid before
the Upper House the grounds of the impeachment in twenty-eight
articles<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. When Strafford read the articles he took courage. He
wrote to his wife that there was not a capital offence in any one of
them: he hoped that these storm clouds would soon disperse, and that
they should live to spend calm days together. It is an indication of
his opinion, that he sought and obtained the King’s leave to mention in
his defence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> deliberations which had taken
place in the Privy Council, in spite of the oath which he had sworn to
observe secrecy.</p>

<p>The commencement of the proceedings before the Lords in Westminster
Hall was delayed till March 22. Then the Lords took their seats in
their proper order of precedence on the platform which had been erected
on the floor of the Hall. The members of the Lower House sat on each
side on benches rising in the form of an amphitheatre. Spectators’
galleries had been erected, especially one for the King and Queen, who
appeared there with their attendants. At 9 a.m. Strafford entered.
The manly expression of his countenance was heightened by the marks
of illness under which he was suffering: his whole bearing breathed
confidence in his cause, gravity, and dignity.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the next few days related especially to Irish
affairs. Not without a certain emotion Strafford replied to the
accusations made by the Irish Parliament, which were given in evidence
against him, that he thought to have earned the thanks of the nation.
Among other charges was one of having taken the sum of £24,000 from
the Irish treasury: he pointed out that he had been authorised by the
King to spend Irish money to the amount of £40,000, and repeated with
emphasis that he was an honourable man. Among the heaviest accusations
was one of having kept a sentence of death suspended over a great Irish
noble, Lord Mountnorris. Strafford was able to show that the sentence
was pronounced without his participation, under the existing martial
law, and at his prayer had remained unexecuted: he had wished merely
to show the power of the State to the refractory. Many of the things
laid to his charge the Privy Council had ordered, some the King had
expressly dictated. He was accused of having desired to attach as much
authority to the resolutions of the Irish Privy Council as to the acts
of the Parliament there: he replied that a greater authority had always
been allowed to the Privy Council in Ireland than in England, and that
among a nation so little civilised it must be so. His defence, which
was based on the distinction between the circumstances of England and
Ireland, had in general more truth than the prosecution, which treated
Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> events in the same way as if they had
happened in England. It was not everything that Strafford could or
would justify: but he pointed out that the things which could justly
be imputed to him could only be reckoned as slight offences: the sum
of all these misdemeanours did not amount to one felony, and a hundred
felonies were yet no treason, the three things being altogether
distinct from one another.</p>

<p>With redoubled vehemence the prosecution attacked his influence over
English affairs, in relation to which the violent measures that he
had counselled in his speeches, the furious threats which he had
employed against the citizens of London on their refusal of a loan,
and above all the advice given by him to the King to dissolve the
last Parliament, were imputed as crimes. Strafford calculated that
none of this could be proved against him. But after some delay a
private document was produced, which seemed to admit of no answer:
it was the protocol of the sitting of May 5, already mentioned, in
the hand of Sir Henry Vane. The younger Vane, who belonged to the
separatist party, had found it among his father’s papers, and without
much hesitation had handed it to Stafford’s enemies. According to this
paper Strafford had on that day, in his eagerness to induce the King
to make war on Scotland, reminded him of the Irish troops, of which
he could dispose, and that certainly in language which might perhaps
apply to England also<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. We will not discuss the question whether
Strafford would not have brought the Irish army into England had need
arisen: his disposition renders it not improbable, but as a matter
of legal evidence it did not follow from the words of the protocol,
and he himself gave it an unqualified denial. What will be the end of
it, he added, if words which are spoken in the King’s Privy Council,
half understood or misunderstood by its members, are to be turned
into crimes; no one will any longer have the courage to speak out his
opinion plainly to the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span>

<p>There was no mistaking the fact that the whole produced a great
impression on the Lords: the general voice inclined to the side of
Strafford. The skill and unconquerable energy with which he defended
himself against a whole multitude of enemies had influenced in his
favour the feelings of the women especially, some of whom copied down
the heads of his defence. Stafford’s closing speech, in which he
summed up all these, produced a deep impression on both friend and
foe. It must in fact be reckoned as a remarkable piece of forensic
eloquence, for its thorough discussion of single points, united with
high and proud pathos. After it there seemed little probability of the
accused being condemned by the Lords. The lawyers declared it to be
unjustifiable, since nothing was treason except what was declared to be
so by the express words of the Statute of 25 Edward III. They would not
hear of a constructive proof, of which men spoke: even if it could be
proved that Strafford had contemplated the overthrow of the law, that
would after all be only felony and not treason.</p>

<p>Already it had been proposed in the Commons to try another way to
their end. It was recollected that in earlier times men who had been
impeached, and could not be convicted under the ordinary forms, had
been declared guilty by the sentence of the legislative power, by a
law in parliamentary form (Bill of Attainder). And this proceeding
was deemed perfectly just, since Parliament was competent to make
laws to meet every possible case, and could at all times define high
treason<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. On the introduction of the supplementary protocol, the
Lords seemed inclined to accede to Strafford’s request that he on his
side should be allowed to bring forward new points. But the Commons
thought they saw in this undue favour to the accused: one morning they
quitted Westminster Hall with shouts of stormy impatience. When they
met in the afternoon for their sitting the proposal to try that other
course, which had already been prepared, and was at once proceeded
with, met with a favourable reception: the Bill of Attainder was
read for the first time. They did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> blind
themselves to the danger of thus offending the Lords, and causing a
breach between the two Houses; but the sense of their own strength
was already so fully aroused that they did not shrink from this: they
rather let it appear that though the Commons were not Strafford’s
peers, but his accusers, they meant to pass sentence upon him; they
would declare him and all his adherents to be traitors<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 12th, the debate on the second reading of the bill came
on in the Lower House. On that occasion the initiative was taken by
members of republican sentiments, like Haslerig and Martin. Neither
Pym nor Hampden, the leaders hitherto, were as yet for this course;
they were unwilling to break with the Upper House, which was very much
irritated, and still trusted to its proving pliable. A final conclusion
was not reached on this occasion. The second reading was agreed to, and
took place at the next sitting two days later: but after further long
and close debate it was resolved that the House, as committee, should
be present to hear the arguments of Strafford’s counsel with respect to
the applicability of the existing laws to his case.</p>

<p>These were delivered on April 17. Attorney-General Lane argued that
the Statute of Edward III, by which all the cases that can be treated
as high treason are defined, was not applicable to the present case,
either in itself or constructively. The Commons had chiefly relied on
the proviso appended to the statute, according to which everything
which Parliament might hereafter pronounce to be treason was punishable
as such. The Attorney-General pointed out that this definition,
after having entailed very opposite consequences through changes of
parliamentary faction, had been altogether repealed in the first year
of Henry IV, every one having felt that it was like a sword hanging
over his head. This last argument appeared to the Lords conclusive:
they decided that they had no right whatever to go beyond the letter of
the Statute of Edward III.</p>

<p>The Commons heard this in silence; but they derived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1641</span> from it the impression that if Strafford was to be condemned
it must be by their own action. When they came back to their bill,
they at once entered on the question whether in fact the intention to
overthrow the laws could be regarded as treason. Selden observed that
according to the statute there was only one intention, that namely of
killing the king, which could be treated as high treason. Even the
purpose of taking up arms against him was legally not high treason: how
then could an attempt to overthrow the laws be so regarded? In reply
it was urged, among other points, that the reason why the intention
to kill the king was treason was that it implied the overthrow of the
laws. Finally it was resolved that the attempt to overthrow the laws
should be treated as treason. Once more the actual charges against
Strafford were discussed. The Commons took as sufficiently proven his
acts of violence in Ireland, his support of the war against the Scots,
finally his expressions about the dissolution of the last Parliament.
But in general they did not attach much importance to legal evidence on
the separate points. As a member said, we do not ask how many inches
are required that a man should be called big or little—the sight
determines that: so it is in the present case, we do not enquire how
many unlawful acts will establish a charge of high treason, we all
know that it has been committed. Once more Lord Digby, at an earlier
period one of Strafford’s bitterest opponents, rose to defend him.
Once more he declared him to be the most dangerous man in England, and
his intention to introduce arbitrary government into the country to be
undoubted; but the intention imputed to him, of subjugating England
with Irish troops, was unproved, and he could not fairly be condemned
as a traitor. He ventured to say that this would be to commit a
judicial murder. With all his eloquence he only succeeded in rendering
himself an object of suspicion. By 204 votes against 59 the Bill of
Attainder passed the Lower House<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.</p>

<p>Extremely remarkable are the grounds for this proceeding as put
forward by Oliver St. John, on April 29, in a great conference with
the Upper House, at which the King was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> present.
He urged especially the absolute legislative power of Parliament, in
virtue of which it was not bound, like inferior tribunals, by existing
laws, but was justified in making new ones to suit circumstances: its
only guide should be care for the public weal: it was the political
body, embracing all, from the king to the beggar, and could deal with
individuals for the good of the whole, could open a vein to let out
the corrupted blood. It had been said that the law must precede the
offence; that where no law was there could be no transgression: but
that plea could not avail for the man who had desired to overthrow
all laws: there might be rules for the hunting of hares, wolves were
slain wherever they were found. Strafford had well known that the Lower
House had the power of life and death<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. Strafford had thought to
be judged by the existing laws, and had always taken the most careful
precautions to avoid acting towards them in such a manner that a
capital charge could be brought against him. But now there was a power
set in motion against him which did not consider itself bound by the
letter of the statutes, and held itself fully justified in punishing
not only his acts but his intentions.</p>

<p>When he heard St. John’s speech he saw that he was lost: he raised his
hands above his head, as if to implore the mercy of heaven. His case
was not yet finally decided, but in order that he might be rescued
events must have happened, and courses have been tried, which lay
outside all regular government. In the violent agitation produced by
the great questions involved, there was actually once a moment in which
such a turn of events might possibly have been expected: this arose
from the inner complications of the state and court.</p>

<span class="small">ATTEMPT AT A REACTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is extraordinary that amid all these storms men actively and
zealously pressed for the high offices of state. Northumberland gave
himself immense trouble to obtain for his brother-in-law, Leicester,
the post of Lord Deputy of Ireland, or Secretary of State. He entered
into negotiations with the elder Vane, with Hamilton, with every one
who could in any way help him to this end: he even approached the King
himself<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. In fact the King was thinking very seriously of filling
the most important places with members of the now dominant opposition.
Cottington and Bishop Juxon, the former, so far as is known, by express
agreement with the opposition, were dismissed from their high and
lucrative offices, in order to save them from sharing the ruin of
their party. The plan was formed of appointing in their places the
Earl of Bedford as Lord Treasurer and First Minister, and John Pym as
Chancellor of the Exchequer; the King hoped that by their means his
income would be fixed, and among other things tonnage and poundage
voted to him in perpetuity. The Secretaryship of State, vacated by
Windebank’s flight, was destined for Hollis, the post of Master of the
Court of Wards for Lord Say. Other great offices were spoken of for
Essex, Mandeville, and Hampden<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>The direction of foreign affairs also was to be confided to new hands.
The French hoped through parliamentary influence to detach the King
entirely from Spain, and induce him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641</span> to interfere
actively in general European politics. For this they chiefly relied
on Lord Holland, who seemed to them the man best calculated to bring
about an alliance between the two crowns. Montereuil was in perpetual
communication with him; he can never sufficiently praise his devotion
and zeal. One day Holland spoke to this effect to the King, who was
very much pleased to find that France, by whom he feared that he was
despised, desired an alliance with him<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. It depended on this turn
of politics whether or not the English royal pair accepted the proposal
of a family alliance which came from the Prince of Orange: the Lower
House received with satisfaction the news of this offer. The court
had another and private motive, as expecting pecuniary and political
support from the Prince, for whom it was of the greatest importance
to enter into close connexion with a royal house. Lord Holland was on
as intimate terms with the ambassador of Orange as with the French.
His great hope was to make himself necessary, and so to attain to the
leading position in England, which had ever been the object of his
ambition.</p>

<p>It was now the openly expressed condition that whatever changes might
be contemplated, royalty must not be further attacked. The King would
not allow either the Viceroy of Ireland to be condemned to death, or
Episcopacy to be abolished. The ministers, to whom he was compelled to
entrust power, must shield him from the lowering of dignity and loss
of authority with which he saw himself threatened. In fact ever since
the first overtures of the court to the Lords of the Parliamentary
party, the latter had, it was thought, inclined in favour of Strafford
and the bishops<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>. If the Lords had had so great an influence in
causing the outbreak of the troubles, it might be hoped that they would
be equally powerful in lulling them to rest. But the growing popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> tendencies were already become too strong to
be mastered by any influence whatever. Political movements may be
originated or promoted by personal interests; but an individual when
he has attained his own ends can scarcely ever succeed in confining
them within definite limits. Immediately the Lords saw their popularity
diminish; and the Scots, who were supposed to have an understanding
with them, were bitterly abused. Other circumstances, such as the death
of Bedford, may have contributed to this result: but in the main it was
the force of events which burst asunder the personal alliances that had
been attempted.</p>

<p>The more obviously impossible a compromise proved to be, the stronger
grew the sentiments of natural hostility. Perhaps the chief of all were
shown in the case of the Queen, who already felt herself injured by the
sharpness of the anti-Catholic resolutions of Parliament, wounded in
her inmost feelings, and even defrauded of her rights. She had come to
England on purpose to improve the lot of the Catholics: this was the
concession made to her in her marriage contract. Now however she had to
look on when a seminary priest, who had been several times banished,
was condemned to death, and even hesitated to intercede in his behalf,
since in that case the King would have exercised his privilege of
pardon. The excited people demanded of Parliament that the laws should
be carried out without relaxation: the Lower House requested the Lords
to assist in discovering those who had interfered hitherto<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>: so
that it seemed as if the Queen herself, or her personal following,
would be made answerable for her intercession.</p>

<p>The proud and high-spirited daughter of Henry IV would not endure this.
She had so great an idea of the importance of the dynasty from which
she sprang that she complained of the absence of the newly-appointed
French ambassador, little as she had had to praise in his predecessor
while present, because forsooth she thought that he would resent
the arrogance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> of Parliament, and defend her
rights<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. For she never doubted that her brother, Louis XIII, and
his minister Cardinal Richelieu, would maintain the conditions upon
which she had come to England. In February 1641 she formed the plan
of going herself to France, on the pretext that her health required
change of air. It was believed at the time, and doubtless with justice,
that the most important and confidential persons in her suite had
been active in instigating this purpose, because they themselves were
afraid of being called to account by Parliament: Montague, since he
was reckoned a great supporter of the Catholics, Jermyn as having
been concerned with monopolies. Other members of her household,
Goring, Percy, Croft, probably also the Duchess of Chevreuse, would
have accompanied her. But while she sought to withdraw herself and
her attendants from the indignities to which they were exposed, she
calculated also on obtaining support in France. She desired to call
attention to her own rights, as guaranteed by her marriage contract,
and hoped also to awaken the old sympathy of the French for the English
Catholics.</p>

<p>The English Parliament heard of her design with misgivings. They feared
either a real re-awakening of the old religious animosities between the
two nations, or at least a breach in the friendly relations between
the parliamentary leaders and the French government. Lord Holland
hastened to warn the latter against Montague, as a man who would cause
the greatest difficulties, since he had persuaded the Queen to take
Strafford under her protection, which, through her influence with the
King, would very greatly hinder the restoration of a good understanding
with Parliament<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. He declared that Montague had not the cause of
religion at heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> his reason for interesting
himself in the English Papists being that they were friendly to Spain,
and that if France wished to do any good to the Catholics, it would
be better attempted through him, Lord Holland, and his influence with
Parliament. He told the French ambassador one day in plain words
that he did not desire the Queen’s confidence if such people were to
share it with him. Montereuil replied that it was not the wish of his
government, which had no reason to care for these men.</p>

<p>The Parliament had in its power a decisive means of preventing the
Queen’s journey, which would have disturbed relations with France, and
given her suite a new importance: it had only to apply to Cardinal
Richelieu. He cared far more for a good understanding with the
Parliament and its leaders, who possessed the power, than for the
renewal of friendly relations with the court, which was of importance
only when it was on better terms with Parliament. If Richelieu had
to choose between the two, he could have no hesitation. Moreover
the scheme of re-awakening the sympathy of the French court for the
Catholics abroad was at variance with his policy.</p>

<p>Hard as it was to drive away from the French coasts the sister of the
King of France, who was on the point of coming to Dieppe to breathe
her native air and recruit her health, the Cardinal adopted this
course without much hesitation. When the Queen’s request was laid
before him—it came through an English Catholic named Forster, who had
always been on good terms with the French embassy<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>—he answered
by a refusal. The manner of it was highly characteristic. He did not
write himself, but in order that he might have no cause to fear any
misrepresentation of his language, he let Forster take note of his
words, and submit the report to him. The Cardinal said that the Queen
would be welcomed in France, if the state of her health rendered it
absolutely necessary, but if this were not the case, he prayed her
to consider whether her journey did not admit of a little delay. Her
absence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> from England would be injurious to the
Catholic religion: besides, she would surely not leave her husband
in the midst of his difficulties. Perhaps too it might be difficult
for her to get back to England<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>. Another time, when the present
troubles were removed, he would with pleasure welcome her in France.</p>

<p>The Queen was beside herself with rage when she received this answer.
She said among her friends, that though the conduct of Parliament
grieved her much, she felt the behaviour of the Cardinal more deeply
still. She uttered much strong language in a very bitter tone, and is
said to have added that for her life she would never set foot on the
soil of France, unless to assert her husband’s rights over it.</p>

<p>As however she must stay in England, she was in no way disposed
peaceably to await further injuries. The course of events, the aversion
displayed in many quarters to the violent measures of Parliament,
powerful factions in all three kingdoms, awakened in her the hope of
even yet being able to excite a reaction.</p>

<p>Above all there was known to be a royalist feeling in the army, which
was still in quarters in the North. It was jealous of the superior
care bestowed by Parliament on the Scottish troops: besides, it was
unwilling to suffer the royal power to be abased, or to pass under
the authority of the dominant faction in the Lower House. The Queen
asserted later<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> that the impulse did not come from the court, but
that the offers made were voluntary. The first to come forward were
officers who had seats in Parliament, such as Captain Ashburnham,
who sat for Ludgershall, Wilmot who sat for Tamworth, and especially
Henry Percy, member for Northumberland. They considered that the army
had grounds of complaint against the Lower House, and not against the
King, who even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> these times found means to
supply the wants of the soldiers, and they resolved to offer him their
services. This was in March, when the great questions under discussion
were inflaming the spirits of all. They calculated that if they could
make sure of the Tower, and the army were to advance on London,
Parliament would be obliged to accept the conditions that they might
propose. These were three:—that Episcopacy should be maintained, that
the crown should be endowed with an income equivalent to its former
one, and that the army in Ireland should not be disbanded before
the Scottish army had dispersed. Thus their scheme aimed not at the
restoration of a non-parliamentary government, but at the combination
of the parliamentary constitution with a strong monarchy and the old
episcopal institutions. So at least their words implied. The Queen
states that the majority of officers in the army were agreed on
this. Among the leaders we find her personal friends: they had bound
themselves together by formal oaths.</p>

<p>In Scotland a similar movement had been observed still earlier among
those who had signed the Covenant. In the old castle of Merchiston
is still pointed out a well-preserved room of that date, among the
ornaments of which are conspicuous a crown and the cypher of Charles
I. Here often assembled round Lord Napier a party of friends who felt
themselves at variance with the anti-monarchical tendencies which
the movement in Scotland had developed. Once in the last Scottish
Parliament words had been dropped to the effect that they had no
further need of the King, that they might depose him and introduce a
new order of things. It is true that these men had from aristocratic
<i>esprit de corps</i> opposed the earlier attempts of Charles I, but
from the same feelings, obviously, they would not endure the domination
of any party which might obtain the upper hand in the Committee of the
Estates. In the young James Graham, Earl of Montrose, jealousy against
Argyle, the most powerful member of the Committee, was united with a
loyalty inherited from his ancestors, and now again called to life, to
which he at times gave utterance in vigorous stanzas. Beside him was
old Napier, who might be regarded as his second father, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1641.</span> man of insight and resolution. Others joined these two,
amongst them some of the chief nobles of the country, Home, Athol, Mar:
so early as August 1640 these and others united after the Scottish
fashion in a bond ‘to oppose the particular practices of a few, from
which the country was suffering,’ with reservation of the Covenant,
and to rescue from them the religion, the liberty, and the laws of the
realm<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1641 Montrose and Napier entered into
direct communication with King Charles. They urged him to recognise the
abolition of Episcopacy which had actually taken place in Scotland,
and the constitution of the three estates—for they liked the bishops
and their authority as little as did the other nobles—and then to
come to Scotland and hold a Parliament in person. Among the attendants
of Charles they found no longer any support in Hamilton, who had
reconciled himself to the Scottish commissioners; but Traquair, Robert
Spottiswood, and the Clerk Register Hay, were zealous in their favour.
Traquair, when the commissioners continued to threaten, had sworn to
mingle heaven, earth, and hell together before he would yield. The eyes
of the two parties were turned to the next Parliament: each expected
then to overpower its enemies, and give the vacated offices to its
friends. Montrose and Napier calculated on gaining the support of the
King, who allowed his presence to be looked for. The commissioners were
in great agitation on the subject<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.</p>

<p>Although in Ireland, after the removal of Strafford, there had arisen
a violent storm of indignation against his administration, and against
the Privy Council which had supported him, yet by no means all were
carried away by it. Among other facts we find that the Upper House
postponed to a distant date the discussion of the grievances and
complaints raised by the Lower House, and allowed the Chancellor,
who had been accused by the Commons, to continue his duties as their
speaker. Moreover there was the army which Strafford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1641.</span> had raised: it had been recruited from among the hardiest
natives of the Catholic faith, but still there were many Protestant
veterans among them, and the officers were exclusively Protestant. In
the Irish army the same spirit prevailed as in the English: it would
not abandon the interests of the crown, and it would not allow itself
to be disbanded.</p>

<p>In the meetings at which the spirit of military and loyal devotion
to the throne was displayed, it was deemed possible to bring about a
reaction against the tendencies dominant in Parliament. So far as can
be ascertained, a project was arranged for liberating Strafford from
the Tower, and setting him at the head of an army. The enlistment
which had been sanctioned as for a foreign power might serve for the
purpose of putting trustworthy troops into that fortress: great offers
were made to Balfour, the governor, if he would co-operate. Colonel
Goring, governor of Portsmouth, appeared so trustworthy that he was
let into the secret of the enlistments. If there were once again a
force which should declare for royalty, but in a moderate fashion, it
was expected that support would be forthcoming for it in the remotest
districts. In every discussion in Parliament the Lords had let it be
seen that rebellion was as hateful to them as treason: they would not
let themselves be overborne by a popular faction. The Bill of Attainder
seemed to them an attempt to rob them of their privilege of being tried
by their peers: many other lives, they thought, might be endangered in
the same manner. They were fully conscious of the intimate connexion
between the privileges they enjoyed and the royal prerogative<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.
Why might not all the strength of the clergy and the efforts of the
Catholics be united in favour of a change of this kind?</p>

<p>It was assumed that support for such a movement would be forthcoming
from France. The Queen had already let Montague go over, and the
Parliament was certainly afraid of hostile interference from that
quarter. In order to prevent it at the outset Lord Holland sent word to
France that every favour shown to Montague would be an injury to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> Parliament. Properly speaking, there was no need
of these warnings. It may be affirmed with certainty that the Queen,
after Richelieu’s first refusal, had never approached him again. We
have Montague’s letters, and his purpose seems to have been to go to
Rome: he cherished the hope of being raised to the Cardinalate, through
the recommendations of the Queen, to which he expected to add French
support. It was for this that he intrigued and wrote: at least he never
had any communication on political matters with the leading men of
the French government. Very probably when the Queen first planned a
visit to France there was the idea in the background of seeking help
from thence for a reaction against the Parliament; but if the Cardinal
refused to allow her to cross over, a plan which was opposed to his
policy was little likely to obtain support from him. In England there
was some fear of certain transports which were being fitted out on
the coast of Normandy, but it was known that they were destined for
Portugal. It transpired that one or two captains of French mercenaries
had been spoken to about an undertaking to be attempted in England,
but this was done privately and without visible results. Nowhere as it
seemed had matters advanced very far: every one was still occupied in
preparations and hopes, when suddenly all was disclosed. This came to
pass through one of the officers who had been most relied on, Colonel
Goring, governor of Portsmouth. The Queen states that Wilmot and Goring
had quarrelled about the post which each claimed as commander of the
troops, and that Jermyn had vainly tried to reconcile them<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>. Goring
asserts that he had demanded of the King an express sanction of the
undertaking, but that he could not obtain it<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. Both accounts are
perhaps true. The King would probably have assented, had the thing
been done without him, but he could not bring himself to resolve to
authorise it. Goring however wished to have a retreat: these men, with
all their hopes of success, were perpetually haunted by the thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> that failure would be their utter ruin; and
merely to have known a matter of this sort and concealed it might be
deadly. Colonel Goring, on whose co-operation the whole scheme was
based was induced to make communications to one or two Lords of his
acquaintance. From them John Pym received intelligence, and so had a
weapon put into his hands just when circumstances made it most useful.</p>

<span class="small">PARLIAMENTARY AND POPULAR AGITATION. EXECUTION OF STRAFFORD.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The King was still very far from giving up his own or Stafford’s cause.
On Saturday, May 1, he declared that he would never again endure
Strafford in his council or his presence, but that he thought him not
deserving of death; and the Lords seemed of the same opinion. Equally
little did it seem necessary to give way to the proposals against the
bishops. On Sunday, May 2, the wedding of the young Prince of Orange
with the Princess Mary of England, who however was but ten years
old and was to stay longer in England, was celebrated at Whitehall.
Charles himself presided with address and good-humour over the wedding
festivities, and seemed to be well pleased with his new son-in-law.
Once more a numerous court crowded with the usual zeal around the
highest personages in the country. Yet at that very hour the pulpits
of the city were ringing with fiery addresses on the necessity of
bringing the arch-offender to justice: disquieting rumours were in the
air and kept every one in suspense. The next morning, Monday, May 3,
Westminster presented a disorderly spectacle. In order to throw into
the scale the expression of their will on impending questions, which
already had been so effective once, thousands of petitioners repaired
to the Houses of Parliament: the members of the Lower House who had
not voted for the Bill of Attainder, and the unpopular lords, were
received on their arrival with insults and abusive cries. At the hour
when the sitting of the Lower House ought to have begun—prayers were
already over—all the members remained in profound silence. There was
a presentiment of what was coming: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> attempt
of the clerk to bring on some unimportant matter was greeted with
laughter. After some time the doors were closed, and John Pym rose to
make a serious communication. He said that desperate plots against the
Parliament and the peace of the realm were at work within and without
the country, for bringing the army against Parliament, seizing the
Tower, and releasing Strafford; that there was an understanding with
France on the subject, and that sundry persons in immediate attendance
on the Queen were deep in the plot.</p>

<p>Pym might and did know that the French government was in no way
inclined to take part with the Queen; and the Parliamentary leaders had
already sent their joint thanks to Cardinal Richelieu for preventing
the Queen’s journey<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. We must leave it in doubt whether Pym was
notwithstanding led by the appearance of things and by rumour to
believe in the possibility of an alliance between the French government
and the Queen, or whether he merely thought it advisable to arouse the
apprehension in others. His speech conveyed the idea that a plot was
at work for the overthrow of Parliament and the Protestant religion,
which must be resisted with the whole strength of the nation. The mob
assembled outside the doors, where vague reports of Pym’s exordium
reached them, certainly received this impression. A conspiracy had been
detected, as bad as the Gunpowder Plot, or worse, for massacring the
members of Parliament, and even all Strafford’s opponents among the
inhabitants. The fact that the Tower, which commanded the city, was
reckoned on for this purpose, caused an indescribable agitation. At
times the cry ‘To Whitehall!’ was heard: at others it seemed as if the
mob would go to the Tower in order to storm it<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<p>With these tumultuous proceedings were connected a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1641.</span> consistent and systematic series of decisive measures taken
by Parliament. The strongest motive for agitation in England as well
as in Scotland was the danger to religion: and a similar attempt was
made to obtain security on this point. A kind of covenant was devised
in England also, a Parliamentary and national oath, by which every
man pledged himself to defend with body and life the true Protestant
religion against all Popish devices, as well as the privileges of
Parliament, and the liberties of the subject. Since in this oath
the doctrines, if not the constitution, of the English Church were
maintained, and the allegiance due to the King was mentioned, no
great trouble was found in obtaining its acceptance by Parliament
and the nation. Its importance lies in the connexion it established
between Protestantism and the interests of Parliament: whoever took
it pledged himself to defend the privileges of Parliament. Amid the
general agreement it was not forgotten that an eye must be kept on the
immediate sources of danger. The undeniable needs of the army were
provided for, and precautions taken against any possible movement in
that quarter.</p>

<p>For several days the rumour of impending danger grew: the French
ambassador was warned at that time, as if he or his government had
a share in the matter, and it might still at any moment be carried
out. But in truth the disclosure of the scheme was equivalent to its
defeat. Jermyn and Percy fled; other persons suspected or implicated
were arrested: the Queen herself one day prepared to quit London. But
she had nowhere to go to: she could not but be aware that the Governor
of Portsmouth, with whom she intended to take refuge, had caused the
discovery of the scheme<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>Little as her attempt to cause a reaction may have been matured, it
had nevertheless the effect of doubling the violence of the previous
movement. The royal power itself immediately felt the force of the
shock. The King had sanctioned the proposal to strengthen his hold on
the Tower with trustworthy troops: the number of men that he desired
to introduce was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> not more than a hundred,
but even this now appeared a dangerous innovation. The commandant
Balfour hesitated to admit the troops: the tumultuous mob directed
against it a more urgent petition than ever. The Lords were induced
to make representations on the subject to the King, who justified the
arrangement on the score of his duty to provide for the safety of the
ammunition stored in the Tower, but, in view of the popular agitation,
did not insist on its being carried out. The Lords further empowered
the Constable and Lord Mayor, if necessary, to introduce a body of
militia into the Tower: and thus the control of the fortress which
might keep the city in check began to slip out of the King’s hands.
The measures taken for the security of Portsmouth, for the arming
of the militia in several inland counties for this purpose, and for
the defence of Jersey and Guernsey, those islands seeming to be in
danger from France, were in effect so many usurpations of the military
authority of the crown, however well justified they may have been under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>Out of the necessity for satisfying the English army arose an idea
involving the most serious consequences. As the Scottish army must be
paid, and the Irish disbanded, which was impossible without discharging
the arrears due to it, new and extensive loans were needed. Yet who
was likely to lend money to the Parliament, so long as its existence
depended on the resolve and arbitrary will of the King with whom it had
engaged in violent strife? As the only security for the capitalists,
a provision was desired that Parliament should not be dissolved at
the simple will of the King<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. On May 5 a motion was made to this
effect: on the 6th the special committee brought the bill before the
assembled House: on the 7th it passed the third reading, and went to
the Upper House, where it was agreed to after a few objections of
trifling importance.</p>

<p>The fate of Strafford formed the central point of all these movements
in the nation and in Parliament, of the tumultuous agitation in the
one, and the far-seeing resolutions of the other. For new loans and for
the payment of taxes one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> condition was on all
sides insisted on, that the Viceroy of Ireland should first expiate his
crimes by death<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.</p>

<p>The Lords had alleged the troubles as the reason why they could not
immediately deal with the Bill of Attainder: but the continued terror
at length made all further opposition impossible. The sittings were
now attended chiefly by those in whom government by prerogative,
such as Strafford aimed at, had awakened from the first a spirit of
aristocratic resistance. And when an opinion of the Court of King’s
Bench was given, to the effect that on the points which had been taken
as proved by the Lords, Strafford certainly merited the punishment
for high treason, all opposition was at length silenced: the Bill of
Attainder passed the Upper House by a majority of 7 votes, 26 against
19.</p>

<p>A deputation of the Lords went immediately to the King, to recommend
him to assent to the bill on account of the danger which would attend
a refusal. It was Saturday, May 8/18: in the afternoon the bill,
together with the one for not dissolving Parliament, was laid before
him by the two Houses, with a prayer for his immediate assent to both.
Two or three thousand men had assembled at Whitehall to receive his
answer<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. To their great indignation the King deferred his decision
until Monday.</p>

<p>The following Sunday was to him a day for the most painful
determination—for what an admission it was, to recognise as a capital
crime the having executed his own will and purposes. The political
tendency, if fully carried out, obviously was to separate the crown
from its advisers, and make them dependent on another authority
than that of the King; to make the King’s power inferior to that of
the Parliament. Charles I had solemnly declared that he found the
accused not guilty of high treason: he had given him his word to let
no evil befal him, not to let a hair of his head be harmed. Could he
nevertheless sanction his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> execution? Verily it
was a great moment for the King: what glory would attend his memory had
he lived up to his convictions, and opposed to the pressure put upon
him an immovable moral strength! To this end was he King, and possessed
the right of sanctioning or of rejecting the resolutions of Parliament:
that was the theory of the constitution. But among the five bishops
whom the King called to his side in this great case of conscience, only
one advised him to follow his own convictions. The others represented
that it was not the King’s business to form a personal opinion on the
legality of a sentence; that the acts which Strafford himself admitted
had now been pronounced to be treasonable; and that he might allow
the judgment without being convinced of its accuracy, as he would
a judgment of the King’s Bench or at the assizes. This may be the
meaning of the doctrine, attributed to Bishop Williams, that the King
has a double conscience, a public and a private one, and that he may
lawfully do as King what he would not do as a private man<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. But the
constitutional principle essentially was that personal convictions in
this high office should possess a negative influence. The distinction
must be regarded as an insult to the theory of the crown, implying
its annihilation as a free power in the State. King Charles felt this
fully: all the days of his life he regretted as one of his greatest
faults, that in this case he had not followed the dictates of his
conscience. But he was told that he must not ruin himself, his future,
and his house for the sake of a single man: the question was not
whether he would save Strafford, but whether he would perish with him.
The movement begun in the city was spreading throughout the country;
from every county men were coming up to join the city populace<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.
From a letter of one of the best informed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>
most intelligent eye-witnesses we gather that the idea of appealing to
the commons of the country against the King’s refusal was mooted in the
Lower House<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>. And so far as the assurances given to the Viceroy of
Ireland were concerned, a letter from Strafford was laid before the
King, in which he released him from his promise, and entreated him
to avoid the disasters which would result from the rejection of the
bill, and to sacrifice him, the writer, as he stood in the way of a
reconciliation between the King and his people.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that on May 10 the King commissioned Lord Arundel
and the Lord Keeper to signify his royal assent to the Bill of
Attainder. The next day he made another attempt to return from the
path of justice to that of mercy. Would it not be better to consign
Strafford to prison for life, with the provision that for any
participation in public affairs, or attempt at flight, his life would
certainly and finally be forfeited. He asked the Lords whether this
was possible: they replied that it would endanger himself and his wife
and children. For no relaxation was to be obtained from the universal
disposition both in Parliament and in the city. Unless the King gave
way it would be scarcely possible to maintain his government any longer.</p>

<p>At the news of the King’s submission Strafford exclaimed, ‘That no
one should trust in princes, who are but men.’ The genuineness of
his letter has been denied, it being supposed that others wrote it,
in order to remove the King’s personal scruples: but a thorough
examination of the fact removes every doubt<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. Though Strafford
confirmed in his own person the experience expressed in the words
of Scripture, he himself with his last words gave, with highminded
forbearance, the opinion that it was necessary to sacrifice him,
in consideration of the general circumstances and of the possible
consequences.</p>

<p>Strafford went to the scaffold in an exalted frame of mind. On his way
he saw Laud, who at his request appeared at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> the
window of his prison. The Archbishop was unable to speak. Strafford
bade him farewell, and prayed that God might protect his innocence;
for he had no doubt that he was in the right in fulfilling his King’s
will, and establishing his prerogative. He persisted that he had
never intended either to destroy the parliamentary constitution, or
to endanger the Protestant Church. He did not appeal to the judgment
of posterity, as if he had been conscious that great antagonisms are
transmitted from generation to generation: he looked for a righteous
judgment in the other world.</p>

<p>Such moments must come, in order to bring to light the absolute
independence of success and of the world’s judgment which strong
characters possess.</p>

<p>His guilt was of a nature entirely political; he had done his best to
guide the King in these complications, undoubtedly in the belief that
he was right in so doing, but still with indiscreet zeal. So also his
execution was a political act: it was the expression of the defeat
which he had suffered and occasioned, of the triumph of the ideas
against which he had contended to the death.</p>

<p>The King, some weeks earlier, had been unable to assent to a violent
attempt to rescue the man who had most strongly maintained the
privilege of his crown: he would henceforth do nothing outside the
law. When the forms of the parliamentary state brought about the
condemnation to death of this champion of his prerogative, he had not
the strength to set his word against it. In order not immediately to
endanger his crown, himself, and his family, he signed the bill which
the two Houses presented to him.</p>

<span class="small">CONCESSIONS AND NEW DEMANDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>King Charles thought that he should be able to direct the government
in spite of the preponderance of parliamentary power. At the same time
with the attainder of Strafford he signed the bill which made the
dissolution of Parliament dependent on its own consent. He expected
that this would be given when the pressing questions were settled. His
own conviction seems to have been that hitherto he had grasped at too
much, and he induced himself to make other great concessions.</p>

<p>He had already allowed the substitution, in the patents of appointments
of the judges, for the clause which made their tenure of office
dependent on the pleasure of the government, of another which made it
depend on good behaviour<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, and so put an end to that arbitrary
removal of judges which made them subservient to the government. This
was a change of universal political significance, since the dependent
position of the bench of judges was recognised as the origin of those
decisions in favour of the crown on which the government had based
its pretensions. Now however all those courts were attacked which, at
least in part, had served as instruments of arbitrary power, especially
the Court of High Commission, by which the spiritual jurisdiction had
obtained absolute authority over every deviation from the principles
of the Anglican Church. Next, the Star Chamber, which through the
form of its procedure, that decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> alone on
the facts, the law, and the punishment, and through the extent of
its functions and its harshness even in doubtful cases had incurred
universal hatred<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>:—finally the special courts in the northern
counties, which had withdrawn a third of the realm from the ordinary
course of justice. The original idea had been merely to reform them;
now however that full political preponderance had been obtained, it was
resolved to abolish them, so that the common law, which was intimately
connected with political liberty, might everywhere be re-established.
The jurisdiction also of the Privy Council was confined within narrow
limits. The principles of the Petition of Right in respect to personal
liberty now obtained fresh confirmation. The true ground for arrests
was always to be assigned, and a decision taken before the court within
three days as to its legal validity. The King hesitated a moment when
the bills for the abolition of the Star Chamber and High Commission
were presented to him, saying that he well knew that thereby he should
abandon various fundamental arrangements made by his ancestors for the
government of Church and State. Nor indeed was their abolition approved
on all hands; for the Star Chamber had served to tame the ambition of
the great vassals, and the High Commission to hinder the perpetual rise
of new sects, of which the country was very fruitful. Moreover the
loss of the fines, which formed part of the revenue, was taken into
account<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. But the King would not oppose his own to the general
interest: he wished to put an end to all dread of future oppression
in Church and State, in order to restore mutual confidence. He spoke
to this effect in accepting the bills about the Star Chamber and High
Commission. He said that he thought none could be discontented with him
who considered what he had conceded to the present Parliament,—greater
independence to the judges, triennial parliaments, the perpetual right
of granting tonnage and poundage, against the custom of his ancestors;
finally, the abolition of ship-money. He had also given up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1641.</span> the restoration of the old forest boundaries, allowing them
to remain as they had been in the twentieth year of his father. He
could not admit that the people had had a right to these concessions:
he held firmly to the view that all was free gift in favour of his
subjects, on whose confidence and obedience he might now more than ever
reckon<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<p>He assented to the dismissal of his two armies, the English and the
Irish, convinced that the Scots, now that their demands were satisfied,
would quit English territory. He himself wished to go to Scotland,
according to his promise, and hold a Parliament there.</p>

<p>It really seemed as if the King was willing to accept his present
position, to abandon not only the views which he had before prosecuted,
but also the modes of government of his ancestors, so far as they were
inconsistent with the restrictions imposed on him. Some of the chief
foundations of the royal authority which the Tudors had enjoyed had
been removed. But who could assert that the crown could not be worn,
and be worth wearing, under these conditions? On the other hand it is
clear at the first glance how hard this must again become.</p>

<p>There was some importance in the fact that Charles I was a born king,
with a definite idea of inalienable rights and duties necessary to
be fulfilled, an idea all the more potent in the indefinite state
of the constitution and of the limits of parliamentary power. The
party from which the great impulse proceeded, and which controlled
the debates with its majority, had made a start which would carry it
beyond the limits of the old constitution. Questions were already being
raised, and tendencies exhibited, which implied a new and thorough
transformation.</p>

<p>In the very foreground appeared the religious question. The matter
of the two petitions relating to church affairs had in due time been
brought before the Upper House, and referred for discussion to an
ecclesiastical committee composed of lords of both parties. By it a
sub-committee was appointed, in which distinguished theologians of both
Anglican and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> Presbyterian opinions, Prideaux
and Hacket, as well as Burgess and Young, took part. The chairman of
both was the astute Williams, who had returned from the prison in which
Laud had confined him, to his seat in the Upper House. They busied
themselves with reversing Laud’s arrangements, and with the complaints
against his government, but they had no idea of touching on the
constitution of the English episcopate. Men like Williams lived in the
union of two forms of activity, the spiritual and the temporal. How was
it to be expected that the bishops would rob themselves of their seats
in the Upper House? The temporal lords also were mostly against it.</p>

<p>Among the grievances of which the populace complained in the turbulent
days before Stafford’s condemnation, one of the most important was that
in spite of all petitions the affairs of the Church were not put in
order in a truly Protestant sense: immediately after his execution the
matter was taken up afresh. In the prevailing temper it will easily
be understood that they then reverted to the decided demands of the
London petition. The bill had a near political interest, in so far as
it corresponded to the incessant demands of the Scottish commissioners
for conformity. But they did not rest only on the Presbyterians.
Several men of separatist opinions, Oliver Cromwell, the younger Vane,
Haslerig, had allied themselves to the movement<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. On May 27 a bill
for the entire abolition of the Anglican establishment was introduced.
Archbishops and bishops, chancellors and their commissaries, deans,
archdeacons, and other chapter officials were henceforth to exist no
longer in the Church and realm of England; and the King and two Houses
of Parliament were to dispose of the lands, houses and rents attached
to these dignities and offices. After all that had happened this motion
nevertheless caused the greatest sensation, for none of the changes
which had preceded it were at all like this. Neither ship-money nor
Star Chamber, neither Stafford’s death nor Laud’s prosecution were
comparable to this attempt to overthrow the church government of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> England, and introduce a new one. The proposal
was that in every diocese commissions should stand in the place of
the bishops. The plan found more support in the Lower House now than
formerly; the second reading was carried by a majority of 139 votes
against 118. An objection had been taken that they ought to wait till
the Lords had definitely decided on the first moderate proposition,
which had not yet taken place. They did so just at this time (June 7).
Even under these circumstances their decision was in the negative;
for the Lords would not lend a hand to a change even in the political
position of the bishops whereby the Upper House would be transformed.
The result however was that the new bill was pressed with greater zeal
than ever.</p>

<p>On June 11 the House resolved itself into a committee to discuss it.
Edward Hyde, who was in the chair, asserted at a later period that
though he could not himself speak in the debate, yet he had hindered
the progress of the measure by giving preference to the speakers who
rose in opposition to it<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. But we know well the almost insuperable
difficulties involved in the nature of the case. How should a measure
not meet with opposition which proposed to alter the definite position
of one of the greatest powers in the state, the House of Lords, and to
abolish totally that ecclesiastical authority which had existed ever
since the introduction of Christianity into England, and had not only
survived the Reformation, but largely contributed to it. Episcopacy had
grown up in the closest connexion with all English institutions. If
the guilt could fairly be imputed to it of having shared in the last
encroachments of the royal power, it seemed sufficient, as the Upper
House had determined, to reverse the acts tending in this direction,
and restore the previous order of things. The opposition however was
redoubled when it came to the question of replacing this institution.
It was proposed to establish in each diocese an authority analogous
to the episcopal, which should be moderated by the participation, in
some form or other, of the remaining clergy. Besides, there was an
agreement between the two parties as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>
removal of the bishops, none as to any substitute for them: on this
point their wishes and purposes were in direct opposition. Even under
another chairman there would have been some difficulty in coming to a
conclusion: but neither his dexterity, nor the intrinsic complexity of
the matter, prevented some fundamental parts of the bill and reasons
for them being agreed to by the majority<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>. This was quite a
different thing from the mere petition of the London citizens: a bill
drawn on more advanced principles now threatened the very core of the
ecclesiastical body with complete removal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile John Pym was proceeding with no less comprehensive proposals
to a thorough reform of the political administration. There was a talk
of the long-meditated journey to Scotland, which the King would no
longer postpone. In a conference with the Lords (June 24), Pym brought
forward a number of proposals which it was desirable to settle before
this journey was undertaken. The sum of them was that the King should
dismiss those of his councillors against whom there was just ground of
complaint, and entrust his affairs to officers in whom Parliament had
reason to place confidence<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p>The removal of an unpopular minister, even if so strong a step should
frighten others who were inclined to follow in his footsteps, was not
the final aim of Parliament: it would no longer endure in the highest
offices of the court and state either secret or open opponents. The
King was warned not to let matters go so far as that their names should
be mentioned. The Prince of Wales in future ought to be surrounded by
men publicly held by Parliament to be trustworthy: neither Jesuits
nor Capuchins were to be endured in the Queen’s household: no one
who entered England with instructions from the Pope was to enjoy the
protection of the law: if the King left the country a guard of trusty
nobles was to prevent any Popish intrigues of the Queen’s court. The
internal administration of the realm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> was to
be ordered in the same way: none but adherents of the Parliament
should hold the chief posts in the counties, or be entrusted by them
with subordinate offices. With these was combined the idea of joining
in an oath by which the obedience of the officers and militia to
parliamentary ordinances should be secured, and of placing in safe
hands the ports of the kingdom and the command of the fleet.</p>

<p>Various motives may have conspired to produce these resolutions;
the renewed mistrust of the households of the King and Queen, which
naturally held to the prerogative of the crown, imitation of the Scots,
and rivalry with them, in so far as they aimed at exercising a separate
influence over the King, above all the logical development of the
principles already adopted, which could tolerate no independent action
of the crown. On the occasion of the King’s journey these tendencies
of the predominant party in the Lower House obtained the fullest
expression. It was proposed that for the time a deputy or <i>custos
regni</i> should be appointed, to give the requisite sanction to the
bills that passed the two Houses, or that royal functions should be
entrusted to the Prince of Wales, who was still too young for a will
of his own, perhaps to the Elector Palatine, who was very needy: it
is even said that words were uttered to the effect that there was no
need of monarchical forms<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. If so, this was the first time that
republican sentiments were expressed in the debates of Parliament.</p>

<p>These things however were as yet far off. Though some of the Lords
agreed with the Commons, there was always in the Upper House a majority
which opposed them in decisive moments.</p>

<p>It is plain, nevertheless, that the movement was entering on a
new stage. A simple restoration of the constitution to check the
encroachments of the crown would no longer suffice. The barriers were
in danger of being broken down which the constitution itself placed in
the way of the dominant faction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>The King on his side was resolved not to let himself be dragged so far.
He believed that the church and monarchy, and their mutual connexion,
were too well established in England to be very easily overthrown,
and thought that he could easily defend them both, if he could only
separate the affairs of Scotland from those of England; for he referred
to this inter-connexion all the misfortunes which had befallen him.
This was the chief object of the journey to Scotland for which he was
preparing. Among his advisers some even of those who were reckoned
moderate men cherished this idea. ‘If you may overcome all difficulties
there (in Scotland) I believe it will not be difficult for you to put
all things here (in England) in good order,’ wrote his secretary,
Master Nicholas.</p>

<span class="small">CHARLES I IN SCOTLAND. THE IRISH REBELLION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the middle of August 1641 Charles I reappeared in Scotland after
eight years’ absence. What restlessness had since pervaded the country
from end to end! how completely altered was the position of the King!
In the year 1633 he had begun to establish the monarchical and despotic
system which he had in view: in 1641 he was obliged to accept and
confirm maxims entirely contrary to it.</p>

<p>He assented to the acts of the Assembly at Glasgow and of the
Parliament of 1640: he gave up the bishops in Scotland and submitted
without further hesitation to those claims of parliamentary power
against which he had striven so long and desperately: he ratified the
treaty already concluded by touching it with his sceptre. But all
was not yet over. On September 16 a new act was read, by which the
nomination to the most important offices in the administration of the
state and of justice was made dependent on the approval of Parliament.
The King said that he accepted it in order to supply a need which the
country might experience through his absence: he would in future let
his Privy Council consist of a fixed number of members, never to be
exceeded, according to the advice of the Estates: he would lay before
them a list of those to whom he thought of confiding the great offices
of state, and hoped that it would meet with their approval. ‘At this
gracious answer,’ says the old journal, ‘one and all rose and bowed
themselves to the ground<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>The King’s chief object was to content the Scots, and separate their
cause from the English. The events of the last year had convinced him
that the connexion of Scottish and English affairs had involved him
in all his troubles. The late projects, which were so contrary to
his views, especially the attack made by Parliament on the bishops,
he ascribed to Scottish influence. He believed that he could manage
to resist in England if he could only pacify Scotland, but for this
purpose concessions were indispensable. Even those royalists who
followed Montrose, and had long sought to ally themselves with him,
demanded these as absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Even by these however his chief opponents were not won. The party in
religion and politics which depended on Argyle, and had alone wielded
the supreme power, was unwilling to lose it through new appointments,
or even to share it with those who had hitherto opposed them: they
accepted the King’s concessions, but at every fresh step opposed him
again.</p>

<p>The King could appoint neither chancellor nor treasurer to please
himself, so long as Argyle opposed him. At first a compromise was
effected, by which Loudon, the very man whom Charles had wanted to
treat as a traitor on account of his letter to the King of France, was
elevated to the chancellorship. The King regarded it as a point of
honour to save the men who had been conspicuously true to him from the
anathema denounced against them in Scotland: the terms of an oath which
Argyle had carried through the Assembly were so conceived that the
clergy doubted whether it could possibly be interpreted in the King’s
sense. We know the King’s predilection for Hamilton: now came the
shock of finding that the friend who had advised most of what he had
done against the dominant faction in Scotland himself joined that very
party. To save his life Hamilton had allied himself with the Scottish
commissioners, who again were dependent on the committee, at the head
of which was Argyle: he now openly made common cause with the latter,
and in Argyle’s enemies saw his own.</p>

<p>During these party conflicts some very unexpected scenes happened.
Hamilton and his brother Lanerick quitted Edinburgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1641.</span> one day with Argyle, as their lives were in danger in the
neighbourhood of the King, who inclined to their opponents. Thereupon
the King, who regarded this mistrust as an insult, betook himself with
an unusually numerous train, including all those whom he had taken into
his protection, to the Parliament. It almost seemed as if he meant to
use force against Argyle’s adherents. The rumour was spread that the
fiercest and bitterest enemies of Hamilton, Kerr and Home, and their
borderers, had been summoned to attack him. The consequence was that
the other party armed also, and eventually gained the upper hand. After
a fortnight’s absence Hamilton and Argyle returned, the latter more
powerful than ever in Parliament. The second and third estates, the
barons and burgesses, did nothing without him. Though here and there a
preacher drew to the King’s side, most of them filled their churches
with all the louder complaints against the plots which were being
formed<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.</p>

<p>Unless Charles I were willing to break with the Parliament he had
no choice but to make terms with the men of this party. Argyle was
consulted on all weighty matters: in the nomination to offices,
his friends, the determined supporters of the covenant, obtained
the preference. Instead of the treasurer designated by the King a
commission was named on which sat friends of Hamilton and Argyle.
Lesley, who belonged to this party, was created Earl of Leven with all
the pompous formalities of earlier times, and Argyle was advanced to a
marquisate.</p>

<p>Men could not understand the King’s promoting his adversaries and
passing over his supporters, and bitter complaints were uttered against
him. But it was not his choice: it was necessity arising from the
weakness of his friends and himself. These last concessions, like
the earlier ones, originated in his plans for England. He obtained
a promise from the men whom he promoted, namely, Argyle, Loudon and
Lesley, that they would not interfere with religious affairs in
England, nor ever help the English therein: they pledged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1641.</span> him their honour, as he asserted, that they would not<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.
He meant to separate the ambition of the dominant Covenanters from the
interests of the parliamentary party in England. For his attention was
devoted almost entirely to England, as everything depended on depriving
the revolutionary leaders there of the support which they derived from
their connexion with the Scots. The sequel must show whether he was
not deceiving himself, whether his old enemies now in favour would at
a later time keep their word: but the whole question did not depend on
this uncertainty. The result of the King’s present dealings was that
the Scots attained the independence which had been their object from
the beginning, their leaders retained the posts which they had as it
were conquered, the influence of the crown was virtually annulled. In
comparison to this practical result all the King’s schemes were of
minor importance. For in events once accomplished there is a strength,
independent of the combinations which produced them, which causes
further consequences and reactions.</p>

<p>Through the disturbance of the universal order of things in the British
islands, there was awakened a general and full consciousness of the
elements of which they were composed, which found vent in movements
that mocked at the union to which they had hitherto been subject.</p>


<h3 id="IRISH_REBELLION"><i>The Irish Rebellion.</i></h3>

<p>The government which Strafford had established in Ireland fell with
him, the office of viceroy was entrusted to some of the judges, and
shorn of the powers which gave it authority over the whole country.
The Irish army, which had been formed with so much difficulty, and
maintained in spite of so much opposition, was disbanded without
any attention being vouchsafed to the King’s wish that it should be
allowed to enter the Spanish service. Martial law, even for cases of
rebellion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> was virtually at an end; the High
Commission in Ireland also was declared a general grievance and was
abolished. Under the influence of events in England government based on
prerogative, and on its connexion with the English hierarchy, as it had
existed in Ireland since Elizabeth’s time, fell to the ground.</p>

<p>This revolution however might entail important results. The Irish
people was Catholic: while the Protestant settlers were split into two
hostile factions, and thereby the highest authority in the land, which
bore a really Protestant character, was systematically weakened and
almost destroyed, the thought of ridding themselves of it altogether
was sure to arise in the nation. The steed, never completely broken in,
felt itself suddenly free from the tight rein which hitherto it had
unwillingly obeyed.</p>

<p>The contending principles contributed also to bring about this result.
For it had been part of Strafford’s system to allow some toleration to
the Catholics: they had been by him introduced into the army; he had
winked at a crowd of priests from the Spanish and Netherland seminaries
entering the country and acquiring an ecclesiastical authority to
which the natives willingly submitted. On the other side the national
religious constitution which the Scots had attained by their example
induced the Irish to attempt the same thing, but in the Catholic sense
appropriate to their case. No doubt the old Irish antipathy of the
natives against the Saxons was stimulated thereby; how could it be
otherwise? Still it was the common object of all Catholics, alike of
Anglo-Saxon and of Celtic origin, to restore to the Catholic Church
the possession of the goods and houses that had been taken from her,
and above all to put an end to the colonies established since James
I, in which Puritan tendencies prevailed. The Catholics of the old
settlements were as eager for this as the natives.</p>

<p>The idea originated in a couple of chiefs of old Irish extraction,
Roger O’More and Lord Macguire, who had been involved in Tyrone’s ruin,
but were connected by marriage with several English families. The first
man whom O’More won over was Lord Mayo, the most powerful magnate
of old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> English descent in Connaught, of the
house of De Burgh, of whose ancestors one, a half-brother of William
the Conqueror, came over with him to England; another came to Ireland
with Henry II<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>. The best military leader in the confederacy,
Colonel Plunkett, was a Catholic of old English origin: he had numerous
connexions among the Catholics of Leinster, and had preserved through
the wars in Flanders the religious enthusiasm which led him thither.
Among the natives the most notable personage was Phelim O’Neil, who
after having been long in England, and learning Protestantism there, on
his return to Ireland went back to the old faith and the old customs:
he was reckoned the rightful heir of Tyrone, and possessed unbounded
popular influence.</p>

<p>The plan for which the Catholics of both Irish and English extraction
now united was a very far-reaching one. It involved making the Catholic
religion altogether dominant in Ireland: even of the old nobility none
but the Catholics were to be tolerated: all the lands that had been
seized for the new settlements were to be given back to the previous
possessors or their heirs. In each district a distinguished family was
to be answerable for order, and to maintain an armed force for the
purpose. They would not revolt from the King, but still would leave him
no real share in the government. Two lords justices, both Catholic,
one of Irish, the other of old English family, were to be at the head
of the government. In the Parliament, which should no longer be in any
way subordinate to the English, the clergy also were to have seats and
voices. In the negotiations which preceded the rising, the question had
already been discussed, what should be done with the Irish Protestants
in case of victory. At a meeting of the political and spiritual leaders
held on St. Francis’ day in the Franciscan convent at Mullifarvan in
Westmeath, this question, as well as the form of the future state, was
taken into consideration. The advice of the monks was to drive them
out, as Philip III had driven the Moors out of Spain, without staining
the land with their blood. Others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> remarked
that that prince would have done better to destroy the Moors, since a
lasting evil, the strength of the pirate states, had been increased
by his clemency: in the same way it would be better to exterminate
the Protestants in Ireland than to incur their future hostility—a
consideration of disastrous omen. We do not hear how they decided at
the moment, but the sequel showed what feelings were supreme in their
hearts.</p>

<p>The preparations were made in profound silence: a man could travel
across the country without perceiving any stir or uneasiness. But
on the appointed day, October 23, the day of St. Ignatius, the
insurrection everywhere broke out. In Ulster the O’Neils, under the
leadership of Phelim, succeeded in obtaining possession of Charlemount,
which commanded one of the most important points on the northern
roads. The O’Guires surprised Mountjoy; the O’Hanlons Tanderagh in the
county of Armagh, and Newry, where they found arms and powder: in the
county of Monaghan all, in Cavan, where the sheriff himself headed the
rising, nearly all the fortified posts were seized; here and there the
government troops, where they met the insurgents, carried away by their
impulses, made common cause with them. The insurrection, however, did
not fully attain its object. The chief attack was directed against the
castle of Dublin, where they hoped to gain great supplies of arms and
military stores; and then, with the co-operation of the inhabitants
who sympathised with them, they would have been in a position to defy
the attacks of England. This did not seem a hard thing to achieve, for
the government, which always liked to do the exact opposite of what
Strafford had done, had neglected military matters; it had no troops in
the city, and the castle was very insufficiently garrisoned, so that
it might apparently have been captured by two hundred men. Perhaps
it may be affirmed that the English dominion in Ireland was saved
through some natives of Irish origin having been won to Protestantism.
The conspirators applied to one of these, Owen Conolly, to gain his
accession to their cause. He was an opponent of Strafford, as such
had come into contact with the zealous Puritans during a short stay
in England, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> them had been strengthened
in the Protestantism which he had always professed<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>: he abhorred
the religious tendency of the Irish rising, and on the evening of the
22nd gave information. The government awoke from perfect security to
a sight of their terrible danger: they had still just time to arrest
the leaders who were already in the city, and to secure the gates of
the castle and city, so that those who came up, seeing that they were
discovered, obeyed the order to disperse. Several other places also
held out, as Londonderry and Carrickfergus, and afforded places to
which the Protestants might fly. But no one can paint the rage and
cruelty which was vented, far and wide over the land, upon the unarmed
and defenceless. Many thousands perished: their corpses filled the
land and served as food for the kites. The elemental forces, which
hitherto had been repressed by the strong hand of the government, arose
in the wildest licence: religious abhorrence entered into a dreadful
league with the fury of national hatred. The motives of the Sicilian
Vespers and of the night of St. Bartholomew were united. Sir Phelim,
who at once was proclaimed Lord and Master in Ulster, with the title of
the native princes, as Tyrone had been, and who in his proclamations
assumed the tone of a sovereign, was not at all the man to check these
cruelties. Rather cast upwards by a sudden eruption, than raised by his
own services and exertions, he added fuel to the flame already kindled:
either when drunk, or when for a moment he believed himself in danger,
he ordered the massacre of all the prisoners. Or did this happen in
consequence of their deliberations? Did they wish to put an end for
ever to the claims of the rich settlers by taking their lives? With all
this letting loose of ancient barbarism there was still some holding
back. The Scottish settlements were spared, although they were the most
hated of all, for fear of incurring the hostility of the Scottish as
well as of the English nation.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a rising in the five counties of the old English
Pale: the gentry of Louth, under the leadership<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1641.</span> of the sheriff, took the side of the rebels. The younger men of
Meath assembled on the Boyne, and commenced hostilities against the
Protestants: so completely had their religious sympathies prevailed
over their patriotism. They told the King that being in the midst
between the government which mistrusted them and forbade them arms,
and the advancing rebels, threatened on both sides, they had no escape
left except by joining the latter<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. This agrees with their original
suggestion that if they sought him he might treat them no worse than
the Scots: if he would be gracious to them, they would shed the last
drop of their blood for him.</p>

<p>As the Scots had won from the King the recognition of their national
and religious independence, so also the Irish aimed at a national and
Catholic independence. There is certainly a resemblance, but a far
greater difference. In the one it was a controversy which found vent,
as it were, prematurely in violent demonstrations and domestic feuds;
the other was one of the most cruel insurrections recorded in history.</p>

<p>The King received the first tidings of the Irish rebellion while in
Scotland; he immediately informed the Scottish Parliament and begged
their aid. The Scots declared themselves ready, but delayed to see what
would happen in England. The King, who regarded the cause as his own,
in spite of his distressed circumstances contrived out of his own means
to send over a small force of 1500 men under experienced commanders:
this was the first succour which the Protestants received, and it gave
them courage, and contributed greatly to make the strong places that
had not surrendered in the mean time hold out to the end. False as it
is to accuse Charles I of having himself secretly taken part in this
Irish movement, it is undeniable that it was not altogether hostile
to him. It was above all a reaction against the form of government
derived from the Puritan parliamentary principles in England. The Irish
Catholics told the King, that it was because he, in the fulness of
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> princely love, granted them some religious
liberty, that the English Parliament, envious of their good fortune,
diminished his prerogative: it desired to call the Scots to its
assistance, and with the Bible in one hand and the sword in the other
to extirpate Catholicism in Ireland. It is obvious that Ireland in its
native condition could exist very well under a monarchy clothed with
extensive prerogatives, but never under a parliamentary government with
predominant Puritan sentiments, such as existed and daily grew stronger
in the present Parliament.</p>

<p>We turn our attention to England, to those parliamentary discussions
long before proposed, and now again resumed, to which the course of
things in Scotland, and still more the events in Ireland, furnished a
new and powerful impulse.</p>

<span class="small">DAYS OF THE GRAND REMONSTRANCE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Wearied with the labours of the long session, the English Parliament
during the King’s absence entered on a recess, which was to last from
September 9 to October 28, not however without first appointing a
committee, chosen of both Houses, to despatch current business and
maintain order.</p>

<p>Men breathed again after the tension at which the immense activity of
the last ten months had kept their minds: but when they came quietly to
look back upon the past, the feeling that was evinced was by no means
one of entire satisfaction<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. There was no blinding themselves to
the fact that they had gone far beyond the prospects which had floated
before the eyes of the majority at the time of the last elections to
Parliament. Instead of a restoration of the rights of Parliament on
the ancient footing<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>, the constitution was endangered, and all
power fallen into the hands of a few men, who had the majority in the
divisions. The members who returned to their counties did not give a
very satisfactory report of the mode of carrying on the debates, in
which they were often prevented from stating their views, so that there
was not complete freedom of speech<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. Disapproval was especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> aroused by a resolution which had been passed
in very thin houses during the last days of the session, and clothed
with legal force without respect to constitutional forms. It related
to spiritual affairs. The Calvinistic communion-tables that had been
set aside were again to be restored, the pictures and ceremonial
vessels which had been introduced by Laud to be removed, the bowing
at the name of the Redeemer discontinued, and Sunday on the other
hand to be observed with the Sabbatarian rigour of the Scots. Without
having arrived at a complete agreement with the Upper House, which in
its weakened condition still offered some resistance, but supported
by a minority there which under the circumstances was considerable,
the Lower House issued this ordinance, apparently no longer troubling
itself about the old forms which required the concurrence of the three
components of the legislature. The <i>ad interim</i> commission, of
which John Pym was the most active member, held that this declaration
should be published everywhere, and carried into effect so far as
was possible without a breach of the peace. Lecturers devoted to the
Presbyterian system were appointed side by side with the parochial
clergy who adhered to Anglicanism. The idea was—and it was at the
moment recommended by political considerations—to approach as nearly
as was possible without much ado to the Scottish system.</p>

<p>No doubt the Presbyterians far and wide in the country were well
inclined to assist: but they were by no means so strong in England as
in Scotland; the Episcopal Church had struck deep root in England. Men
would endure no alterations in the Book of Common Prayer, which had so
long formed the basis of their domestic and public devotions: they had
already grown used to the altars, and liked the dignity of the restored
ceremonial: nor were they willing to be deprived of the bishops, who
were popular in many quarters, especially as they were likely to be
easier to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> in order than the many thousands
of lay elders to be substituted for them. Here and there tumultuous
scenes took place in the churches where attempts were made to give
effect to the orders of Parliament: elsewhere the people declared
against the decrees of the Synod of Dort, for the doctrines of Laud’s
system were of an Arminian character: in a great number of counties
petitions were circulated for the maintenance of that episcopal
constitution which had been inherited from the earliest times. Bishop
Williams of Lincoln, who during these months made a personal visitation
of his large diocese, called to remembrance the services of the bishops
in heading the resistance to the aggressions of Rome: he declared it
to be a conscientious duty to abide by the arrangements made by their
forefathers, so long as they were not legally repealed: no one, he
said, should be led astray after the idol of imaginary freedom, for
there would be so many masters that all the rest would be slaves<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.</p>

<p>Williams had belonged to the foremost opponents of Laud and his
regulations: but zealous as he was in resistance to Laud, he was
equally free from all Puritan and Scottish predilections. He refused
to designate the Scots as loyal subjects, as was expected of him in
the thanksgiving service for the restoration of peace with Scotland:
he was willing to allow a limitation of the prelates’ authority, but
insisted on the maintenance of their dignity, and of the forms of
church government. He offered direct opposition to the orders of the
Lower House and its commission, to the extent of declaring that all who
should follow them would deserve punishment.</p>

<p>Among the most important members of the Lower House itself several
seceded on these questions from the prevailing party. Edward Hyde,
who had taken the most active part in the judicial reforms, was
nevertheless far from sharing the systematic hostility to the
constitution of the Church which most of the lawyers then evinced. He
had known Laud well in earlier times, and was fully aware that he was
often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> blamed for what was not his fault: the
errors of the past arose, he thought, from carrying things to excess,
but the church system itself he regarded as defensible and useful.
Contrary to expectation, Lord Falkland adopted the same line: he did
not deny to his old friend Hampden that he had informed himself better,
and changed his opinion. John Colepepper, the man in the whole assembly
best qualified to sum up a debate, declared himself of the same mind,
though religious principles did not to him form the ruling motive
of life. Yet without this a man might well turn aside from the goal
which the majority were striving to reach: he might perceive that the
attempt to impose on England the Scottish system was contrary to the
spirit of the English, and could never be accomplished, and might well
shrink from the state of chaos which might be foreseen. He might also
see in an alliance with the King the best course for the country, and
security for his own future. Perhaps it was a question as little of
high moral resolve as of shameful desertion; it was a peculiar line of
statesmanlike policy which these men had traced out for themselves.</p>

<p>Circumstances were not such as to allow of a return to the tendencies
of the old régime: these had become for ever impossible—there were
no more royalists on principle of Strafford’s type: new foundations
of parliamentary government had been laid and recognised by the King.
The immediate political question was, whether now to restore the old
equilibrium of forces, and maintain the Established Church, or to
proceed further in the destruction of existing institutions. The first
was the policy of the men who now separated from their former friends,
the leaders of the Parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>We find that other districts also took offence at the last steps
taken before the recess, which were regarded as illegal, and lost
confidence in the Parliament<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>. In London placards were posted in
public places, in which the authors of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>
resolutions were denounced as traitors to the King and the nation,
enemies of God and of the public weal: they had conspired with the
Scots against England; if Parliament would not expel them, vengeance
should be taken on them by open force. The magistrates and well-to-do
classes in the capital gave unequivocal proofs of their sympathy with
the King’s cause at this stage.</p>

<p>Thus there appeared manifold and strong leanings against the
party which hitherto had been successful, of an ecclesiastical, a
constitutional, and a popular nature. If now the King returned, without
having to fear any hostility from Scotland, and succeeded in enforcing
his views as to the suppression of the Irish rebellion, he might hope,
with the support of this movement, to resume his throne with a moderate
but still real authority<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>.</p>

<p>Necessarily however these events and possibilities aroused the zeal
of the leaders on the other side. They knew perfectly well that the
King was hoping by his conduct in Scotland to strengthen himself for
resistance in England. The news of the supposed attempt to murder
Hamilton and Argyle produced a great effect: it was assumed that
something similar might be repeated in England. The Lords held frequent
meetings, sometimes at Northumberland’s house, sometimes at Lord
Mandeville’s, sometimes at Lord Holland’s in Kensington, in order to
come to an understanding on the next measures to be adopted. There
was incessant talk of Popish plots and desperate attempts; or fear
was entertained that the Queen meant to depart, in order to increase
the confusion and bring foreign help into England. To interrupt her
connexion with the enemies of Parliament at home, a demand was put
forward that at any rate she should not have English confessors;
against French there was nothing to be said. The apprehension was
loudly expressed that a thorough reaction was impending, which would
reverse all that had yet been conceded, and threaten the utmost danger
to the Parliamentary leaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>In the midst of these contrary agitations Parliament assembled again
on the appointed day, at first not in much greater numbers than before
the recess: but a decided opposition to the dominant party showed
itself immediately. When, among other things, the disobedience to
the last declaration of Parliament was mentioned, and proposals made
for punishing it, nothing could be carried, as the majority held the
declaration itself to have been unlawful<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. When the House filled
the hope might be entertained of achieving, in parliamentary fashion, a
reversal of the majority, and a reaction in conformity with the views
of the moderate party, who had been drawing near to the King.</p>

<p>It was mainly in order to counteract this intention that Pym and his
friends proceeded with the Grand Remonstrance, which in more than two
hundred clauses enumerated the grievances which the King’s government
had occasioned since its commencement<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>. It is, we may say, a kind
of history of the administration: for this estimate of it, though often
disputed and generally rejected, has in later times again obtained
acceptance through the advocacy of some able writers. It is a narrative
of the foregoing events for the purpose of inculpating the royalists
and justifying their opponents. For the latter were beginning to feel
that the general opinion was setting against them, seeking, so they
complain, to reverse what they had done, and hinder what was still
contemplated. The Remonstrance is a party manifesto, containing at once
a defence of the past and a programme for the future. Above all it was
intended to represent the steps which its framers still purposed to
take, as being the necessary consequences of those which Parliament had
taken from the very beginning.</p>

<p>As in April and November 1640 John Pym had referred all the evils in
England to an intention of changing the religion and the government,
so now in the Remonstrance proof had to be given that the King had
been from the first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> and still was, ruled by a
Jesuitical faction. The dissolution of previous Parliaments, the war
with France and its disastrous result, the increase of the spiritual
power—for Episcopalians, Arminians, even Libertines, were all
represented as in league with the Papists—the opposition which many
good laws had met with in the Upper House—all was deduced from the
same source. Just then was published the news of the rising in Ireland
and of the cruelties perpetrated there. It made naturally a very
great impression, and was regarded as a confirmation of the general
complaints. There was no idea of other influences, or of the effect
which the harsh behaviour of Parliament itself had had on the course of
events: it was more than ever regarded as the chief merit of Parliament
that it had opposed and checked Popish tendencies. And still the same
danger was threatening: for the future the same determined resistance
was necessary, and the only hope of rescue lay in Parliament. There was
no doubt of the good-will and firmness of the Lower House: but this
would avail little if met in the Upper House by the hostility of the
bishops and lords inclined to Catholicism. Thus the way was paved for
a return to the earlier projects of a thorough ecclesiastical reform.
From the imminent danger in which the country was, and which had one
of its sources in the ecclesiastical constitution, was deduced the
necessity of transforming the latter. ‘We admit that our design is to
put an end to the excessive power of the prelates, and deprive them
of their temporal dignities and offices.’ It was proposed to call a
general synod of the chief theologians of the island, that is to say
including the Scots, with the assistance of some foreigners, for the
purpose of taking counsel on the good government of the Church, their
conclusions to be then carried into effect by Parliament. A standing
commission of members of Parliament was demanded, to present systematic
opposition to Popish aggressions, and to watch over the observance of
the laws against Papists. Then came the demands long before announced,
and now more strongly urged in consequence of the concessions made
to the Scots, that the King should admit to the chief offices, in
relation to foreign as well as domestic affairs, only persons in whom
the Parliament could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> confide: otherwise, it was
unreservedly stated, they could grant no more subsidies.</p>

<p>These were the two great demands at which the earlier negotiations
had stopped, the abolition of episcopacy, and the appointment of
high officials subject to the approval of Parliament: they were now
discussed in connexion with each other. The Remonstrance contained
more than a mere statement of grievances: if the Lower House adopted
it, it at once made these demands definitely its own, and resolved to
carry them. It thereby returned to tendencies which had formerly been
dominant but recently had become dubious, and adopted the watchword
under which the Scots had broken down the preponderance of the crown.</p>

<p>We must observe that the Remonstrance had also a certain connexion
with foreign affairs. The Queen had expected much from the arrival
of the new French ambassador La Ferté Imbault. In June 1641 he
appeared, bringing her assurances of friendship from the King of
France and Cardinal Richelieu, which pleased her greatly. La Ferté
followed nevertheless in the footsteps of Bellièvre: he connected
himself with Lord Holland, who, without being himself conspicuous in
Parliament, exercised some influence over the direction and management
of affairs<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>. He was present when the lords of the minority met
at Holland House, and did not hesitate to maintain also an intimate
connexion with the members of the Lower House: he kept company with
them, though far below him in rank according to the social ideas of
the age<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>. He assured the Queen that these alliances would give him
power to serve her; and she declared herself satisfied: she seems at
the least to have reckoned that the influence of the ambassador would
check the violence of hatred against her, but in fact he entered into
close confederation with her opponents. The Queen was most anxious
to support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> her Catholic co-religionists: the
ambassador found that they were as a body inclined to Spain<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>, and
in consequence did little or nothing for them.</p>

<p>On the other hand the leading men in Parliament were enemies of Spain.
The idea had dawned upon them of making a new attempt on the West
Indies, hostile to that power: the English sailors and soldiers in the
Spanish service were summoned to quit it under heavy penalties. Hence
the French ambassador was their ally. One day he made an offer to the
King of French assistance in Ireland, but this was not done without a
previous understanding with his friends in Parliament, who approved
because the insurgents represented the Spanish and Catholic interest.
Both parties thought that the King favoured Spain and the Catholics:
just at the moment they were afraid, in consequence of the presence of
an imperial plenipotentiary, of the renewal of an understanding between
England and Spain, in which the Netherlands should participate; the
members promised the ambassador to try and induce the King to break
with Spain, and conclude at last the often talked of alliance with
France<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Remonstrance were described the counsellors whom the King was
not to endure: these were not merely those to whom actual crimes could
be imputed, but also favourers of Popery, friends of foreign powers of
other creeds, all who spoke contemptuously of Parliament, or sheltered
great offenders. So ran the official document. In the speeches however
the offensive persons were actually named; the chief of them were
Bristol and his son Digby, as they themselves well knew. The same
men were also regarded, and doubtless rightly, as supporters of the
leanings towards Spain; they were said to be forming a new Spanish
cabal<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. The Remonstrance contained almost a personal vote of want
of confidence against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>The one decisive question with relation to all matters both domestic
and foreign was now whether the Remonstrance would obtain a majority
in the Lower House or not. On this it depended whether England would
maintain the regal and parliamentary forms after the ancient fashion,
together with episcopacy and substantial power vested in the crown, or
whether it would change to the system adopted in Scotland, and unite
with Presbyterianism the complete preponderance of Parliament. Existing
circumstances, old associations, the intuitive and habitual inclination
of the people, pointed to the one: the great agitation of the last
year, the attempt once undertaken, urged men strongly towards the
other. The clauses of the Remonstrance were first discussed singly, and
one or two were opposed, but without any practical result. The final
debate took place on November 22. Its importance is illustrated by
the words of Oliver Cromwell, that on its issue depended the question
whether or not he could stay in England. Only if the majority accepted
the Remonstrance could he see any future for himself in England. Many
others held similar opinions. The rejection of the Remonstrance would
have driven to America the champions of the ideas expressed in it.</p>

<p>Edward Hyde opened the debate by declaring a phrase in the Remonstrance
inconsistent with the King’s dignity: he added the remark that the
defence of their liberties was not opposed to the existence of the
crown. ‘We will not be subjects of a contemptible king, any more than
he be king of contemptible subjects.’ Lord Falkland approached more
nearly to the questions at issue. He specially defended the bishops,
who were unfairly accused of Popish tendencies, and even charged with
having promoted idolatry. Then he referred to the proposal that the
King’s nominations should be subject to the approval of Parliament,
which he characterised as impracticable and ludicrous. Edmund Waller,
who had already broken several lances with Pym, added that in this he
was going against the laws: for that the Lower House was chosen by the
freeholders to make the laws, not to see that the King’s counsellors
were appointed according to their pleasure. Edward Dering asserted
that the wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> of the people had now been
satisfied, and that they desired no accusations for the past, nor yet
promises for the future, such as the Remonstrance contained. John
Colepepper declared that they had no right, without the concurrence of
the Lords, to publish this Remonstrance, for that the Lower House was
chosen to transact business with the King and the Lords, not to issue
declarations to the people; moreover that the hostility of the people
would very soon be shown if they meddled with episcopacy.</p>

<p>Pym and Hampden took the chief part in defending the Remonstrance. Pym
justified the harsh expressions against the bishops, on the ground
that the reverence paid to the altars was in fact idolatrous, and the
pretension in regard to the King’s advisers, on the ground that the
wicked designs against which they had had to fight originated in the
immediate neighbourhood of the King. He said that the heart of the
people would be won when they ascertained how the Lower House was
treated: as for seeking the assent of the Lords to the Remonstrance, it
was a contradiction in terms, as it contained complaints against the
Lords themselves. Hampden declared that they were only doing what was
natural; the Lower House had been loaded with reproaches, and these
they repelled: evil counsellors were close at hand and very powerful,
and these they exposed. The attacks made on their new church policy he
retorted with a text from the Apocalypse predicting the victory of the
true church, and the fall of all other worship<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus reasons and counter-reasons were urged without any one being able
clearly to pronounce in which way the scale inclined. At last the
opponents of the Remonstrance must have begun to fear that they should
be in the minority: they determined to resist as long as possible,
and if that failed, to proceed to a protest. It was midnight before
they could come to a decision. It was resolved first of all to settle
the text of the Remonstrance, and then take the final vote: at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> the question was put whether the Remonstrance as
amended be agreed to or not. On this the House divided; the votes in
its favour were 159, those against it 148. It had passed by a majority
of eleven.</p>

<p>Still the affair was not ended. A new agitation was aroused by the
motion that the Remonstrance should forthwith be printed. The royalist
party thought this unendurable, as setting this document before the
populace would be an act of hostility against the King. Edward Hyde
declared that the House had no authority to do it without having
consulted with the Lords: he added that if it passed he should pray
for leave to enter his protest. His cautious expression shows that he
regarded the right as dubious. But a step was taken which rendered an
immediate demonstration possible. Geoffrey Palmer, a lawyer, rose to
ask for the appointment of a day on which the right to a protest might
be enquired into: meanwhile the names might be taken of those who would
sign such a protest in case of its being pronounced legal. He seemed to
ask who was prepared for this; a great crowd rose to their feet, with
the cry ‘All, all.’ Was not this however in fact a protest, in spite
of the doubtful legality? Inevitably it excited immense agitation. The
steadfast zeal of the one party balanced the enthusiasm of the other.
They waved their hats above their heads, knocked on the ground with
their swords; it seemed as if they must come to hand-to-hand fighting.
As they sat or stood opposite each other they felt that they could
plunge their weapons into one another’s bodies, like Abner’s and Joab’s
young men at Hilkath Hazzurim. In that narrow, crowded, dimly lighted
room of the chapel, men felt almost as in the valley of the shadow of
death<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>. A few conciliatory words from Hampden availed to recall
them to their senses. The proposed resolution was in fact not put.
Without bloodshed, but in the utmost excitement, they separated late at
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>Geoffrey Palmer had to atone for his conduct by a couple of days’
imprisonment in the Tower. But the question he had raised, how far a
protest of dissentient members was allowable in the Lower House, was
of so great importance, that when once it had been spoken of it must
necessarily be settled.</p>

<p>The right of protest existed in the House of Lords, in the Scottish
Parliament, in the Legislative Assemblies of the Continent: the very
name of the religion acknowledged in England was derived from a protest
offered in the German Diet. Why should there be no power of exercising
it in the English Lower House? There was no precedent for it, but there
was none against it: and how many things were then done for the first
time. Two reasons were urged for the right of protest, which rest on
the inmost sense of individuality: one is that the individual cannot
possibly be compelled to assent to the majority if it adopts illegal
or irreligious measures: the other is that otherwise in case of a
revolution, the innocent would have to suffer with the guilty. It is
obvious that these reasons could not prevail with a majority which was
in possession of the right to pass universally binding resolutions. The
majority argued that the ancient formulae cut off the possibility of a
declaration of dissent. John Pym stated on this side a reason of great
significance. The Lords, said he, are in the Upper House in virtue of
their individual and personal rights: every man acts for himself, so
that he is not unconditionally bound by the majority. But the case is
quite different with the Lower House, which represents the nation:
there no dissent is allowable. He assumed that the united will of the
nation was expressed through the majority of the members of the Lower
House elected by it. That a national assembly represents the nation,
had very often been said: but that is very far from the view that this
representation belongs to the Lower House, an idea on which is based
the legality of all revolution. It very naturally originated with the
leader accustomed to be followed by a majority which he had himself
done most to form: in its assent he read the assent of the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>Apart from the essential importance of the principles involved, the
fact that the resolution was passed, and that under no circumstances
durst members of the Lower House enter a protest, had great importance
for the moment. The whole authority which the conclusions of the Lower
House possessed with the nation went in favour of the proposals against
the bishops and for the termination of the King’s power of nomination,
which had passed on the night of November 22 by so narrow majority.</p>

<span class="small">FORMATION OF A NEW MINISTRY. TUMULTUOUS AGITATION IN THE CAPITAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The King was and remained determined to give way on neither point:
while the anti-episcopalian tendencies were gaining the upper hand
in the Commons, he had in a measure newly constituted the episcopal
bench. The vacant sees, of which there was a great number, he filled
without any limitation of their authority: in order to give proof of
his genuine Protestant sentiments, he chose learned men of moderate
views. Dr. Prideaux, one of the best professors at Oxford, a scholar
and logician, and possessed of the most extensive theological
learning, obtained the bishopric of Worcester. Dr. Brownrigge, a
Cambridge Fellow, and possessing the sort of intellect at once solid
and versatile, which is calculated to shine in public discussions,
received the see of Exeter; Westfield, a popular preacher, that of
Bristol. Bishop Hall, whose moderation had brought him under suspicion
of being inclined to Presbyterianism, was advanced to the bishopric
of Norwich; and Bishop Williams of Lincoln, who at the moment had
developed a rare episcopal activity, to the archbishopric of York. Thus
it was not the adherents of the Canterbury system, the old friends
of Laud, who obtained the preference. The King wished to give the
Church representatives free from all suspicion of a leaning towards
Catholicism; and by this he caused the most thorough satisfaction to
all the friends of the Church.</p>

<p>On November 25, the third day after that stormy sitting, he returned
to London: once more he was welcomed with joyful sympathy, and as
heartily as he could wish. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> Recorder, in
the name of the city, expressed confidence that he would defend the
established religion: the King answered that he would prove his love to
the people by maintaining intact the laws of the realm and of religion,
as they had stood under his father and Queen Elizabeth—as if with a
presentiment of the coming storm, he added, even at the risk of his
life and all that was dear to him<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>. He had just confirmed the city
in its rights, and restored the possessions in Ireland which had been
taken away under Strafford. To prove their gratitude the magistrates
had invited him to a banquet in Guildhall. On the way thither, as well
as in going thence by torchlight to Whitehall, he was greeted with
triumphant shouts. He derived thence a conviction that he would have
the general voice in his favour if it came to open war between him and
the Parliament: and that war was imminent no one could doubt.</p>

<p>On December 1 the Remonstrance was presented to the King at Hampton
Court, by a deputation of the Commons. It was accompanied by a
petition, in which the two chief demands, on which all the rest
depended, were repeated in strong terms—that he would deprive the
bishops of their temporal authority, and moderate their spiritual power
so far that all oppression in doctrine, government and discipline
should cease—that he would banish the malignants from his council,
and admit no influence from the opposite side, however near or high
the quarter from which it came. The request was appended that the King
would not restore to the rebels their forfeited possessions in England,
but keep them for the public service. At this and some other points
the King let an exclamation of ironical astonishment or disapproval
escape him; at the rest he exhibited neither anger nor annoyance, he
only expressed the wish that the Remonstrance should not be published
without his concurrence.</p>

<p>He had undoubtedly however resolved to resist with all his might the
purposes disclosed in it. On the day after the presentation of the
petition he showed this by a proclamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>
which, in opposition to the ordinance of the Parliamentary commission,
forbade all deviation from the Book of Common Prayer. In relation to
the other disputed question he acted in the same manner as in reference
to spiritual affairs. It had hitherto remained doubtful on what
principle the highest posts not yet disposed of should be filled up:
in the last few months there had been again a talk of introducing men
like Hollis and Pym into the highest ranks of the administration<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>.
Even for the household posts there were candidates who reckoned on the
support of Parliament. When however the opposition, which it was hoped
had been lulled, again exhibited itself in so direct and implacable
a form, the King would no longer think of any such approximation,
as it would in fact have been endorsing the claims of the Commons.
The dignity of Lord Steward, to which the Lower House wished to see
the Earl of Pembroke appointed, was conferred by Charles on James
Stuart, Duke of Lennox and Richmond, who, like his ancestors, was in
the confidence of the royal family. Just as little was he disposed
to entrust the office of Lord Treasurer to the Earl of Salisbury,
the son of Robert Cecil: he named as Chancellor of the Exchequer,
John Colepepper, one of the leaders of the minority. The two Vanes
lost their posts, the elder to his bitter chagrin the Secretaryship
of State, in which he had grown grey; and Lord Falkland was induced
to undertake it. Edward Hyde as yet received no office, though he
took part in all deliberations: he busied himself in answering the
Remonstrance which he had so vainly resisted at the time. But the
soul of the ministry was Lord Digby, another of Charles I’s advisers
who came over to him from the opposition. The Queen asserted that
she had by her personal intervention induced him to change sides.
After he had, in the debate on the Bill of Attainder, broken with the
majority in the Commons, which threatened to make him answer for his
language, he was transferred to the Upper House, and obtained a post
about the King’s person. He was a man of universal culture, who had
seen many countries, and possessed very varied knowledge, amiable when
he liked, and spirited, at once versatile and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>
resolute. His speeches are favourably distinguished by good taste and
happy expression from the style of his contemporaries: in the history
of parliamentary eloquence he deserves a place. He found his chief
support in his father, Lord Bristol, the only one of those who had been
admitted into the council at the beginning of the year who exerted
any real influence. Charles I once more selected from Parliament an
enemy of Buckingham, whom he had attacked with the help of Parliament
in former times. Now however their sentiments were no longer those
prevalent in Parliament: both father and son had become favourable to
Spain and to royalty.</p>

<p>Regarded in the light of later events it may seem strange that the King
should have chosen his ministers from the minority and not from the
majority. At the moment however the prospect was adverse to the demands
of Parliament: while the King was sure of a large minority in the Lower
House, of a majority in the Lords, of the great episcopal interest, and
of a favourable sentiment among the people, he thought that he need not
fear a hostile majority. The Queen in the course of December believed
that her party would supplant, conquer, and punish the opposition.</p>

<p>The French ambassador distinguished between the Spanish cabal, and the
other which consisted of his friends. ‘Each of them,’ said he, at the
beginning of December, ‘does all it can to ruin the other. The Spanish
party has been strengthened by the arrival of the King; he has a great
idea of the strength of his adherents in both houses, and hopes with
their aid to be able to restore his authority.’ In Parliament there
grew up against Bristol and Digby a hatred similar to that which had
once been felt against Strafford: on the other hand Holland, Essex,
Say, Hertford, saw themselves threatened in their offices by the court
party. It was still very doubtful which side would remain masters of
the field: meanwhile the leaders of the Commons had reason to fear for
their lives.</p>

<p>When the nature of the opposing principles and the strength of the
parties embodying them were such as to produce a sort of equilibrium,
or state of suspense, a change in the municipal representation in
London, which went in favour of the revolutionary cause, was of all the
greater moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>Although Episcopacy was liked by the magistrates and wealthy classes,
Presbyterian opinions preponderated on the whole, and decidedly so in
the middle and lower classes. The zealous and well-attended sermons,
in which religious exhortation bore also a political character,
contributed greatly to this. How great must have been the confusion
when the deviations from Anglican usage which had been introduced
under the protection of Parliament, were pronounced invalid, and had
to be abandoned<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>. It is very intelligible that the declaration of
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in favour of the bishops should have been
met by counter manifestations on the part of the commonalty. At the
beginning of December a petition was prepared in the city, and accepted
in spite of the opposition of the Lord Mayor, in which the city adhered
to the views of the majority in the Lower House, and fully adopted
as its own the idea already prevalent there, of excluding the popish
lords and the bishops from the Upper House. The great contest on the
relations of Church and State which divided the nation was first fought
out in the city of London. A considerable part of the public authority
was here in the hands of the Common Council: those elected to a seat
there had come to enjoy almost a personal life-long right, and it was
the first step to the magisterial bench. Hitherto men of moderate
opinions, such as had been expressed on the occasion of the King’s
return, had had the upper hand there: now however the city populace
found them not zealous enough for religion, and too much inclined to
make terms with the court. Their chief crime was intending to petition
in favour of Episcopacy and the Book of Common Prayer. At the new
elections, which took place at this time in the various parishes and
wards, a sudden change was made. The adherents of the government and
of the bishops, such as Benyon and Drake, were rejected, and zealous
Presbyterians were elected instead, though they might be less wealthy:
many belonged to the class of artisans<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span>

<p>The King had originally intended, since he did not fully trust the
temper of London, to spend the winter at Hampton Court: he was induced
by the good reception he met with at the city, and by the assurances
of the authorities, to promise that he would spend Christmas at
Westminster<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>. Thus he was very closely affected by this change.</p>

<p>In the city there appeared an ever-rising ferment. If anything in
the world was calculated to rouse their passions it was the horrible
violence committed against the Protestants in Ireland: this must
necessarily have awakened Protestant fellow-feeling. They were ready to
contribute towards the Irish war; even in the Common Council numerous
subscriptions were offered: but at the same time they demanded security
for the good management of the undertaking, and the most rigorous
execution of the penal laws. It almost seemed as if they had to fear,
from the system of government, similar terrible consequences in
England: the outbreak of a fire in their neighbour’s house made them
fear for their own. Then came the publication of the Remonstrance,
which was printed in spite of the King’s request and the opposition of
the minority. It appeared palpable that the King was ruled by Popish
influence. We have political ballads extant in which the alliance of
the bishops and the Papists is depicted as the great danger of the
country and of religion. But there are, it is added, courageous hearts
ready for resistance; the best of the King’s subjects are prepared to
do what will break the yoke of Antichrist, and to gain for England the
liberties which Scotland has secured.</p>

<p>A fast-day was held on December 22. In a letter of this day it is said
that extraordinary devotions are necessary to implore the grace of God
for the averting of the storms which are breaking over the country; he
may deem himself happiest who has least to do with it.</p>

<p>During this general uneasiness the King issued an order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1641.</span> which was exactly calculated to cause a complete outbreak.
As a part of the system already adopted, of substituting for men of
popular opinions and connexions, who held any important post, others
of greater inclination towards the King’s service, William Balfour, a
Scot, the Constable Lieutenant of the Tower, the same who had refused
to allow the introduction of a small force, was dismissed from his
office, and replaced by a friend of Digby’s, named Lunsford, a soldier
by profession, who had served in the northern army. But he was regarded
as one of the most dangerous of the malignants: he was said never to
have been seen in a church, to be violent and dishonourable, laden
with debt, and capable of any desperate resolve. His appointment made
the worst possible impression on the city, which would not see a
portion of its wealth, the gold and silver bullion in the Tower, left
in such untrustworthy hands. The Lower House thought they saw in it
the beginning of a violent reaction, and requested the Lords to unite
with them in praying for the revocation of the appointment. Though
the Upper House declared, in reply, that the appointment and removal
of officers belonged to the royal prerogative, with which they had no
right to interfere, the Commons proceeded to resolve that Lunsford was
unfitted for the place, ‘as a person in whom the Commons of England
cannot confide<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>;’ and since the Upper House was only prevented from
concurring by the votes of the bishops, they begged the members of that
House who were of their opinion to act as men of honour. This message
was received by the Lords on December 24: the majority was in favour
of postponing the matter to the first sitting after Christmas, on the
27th. But at this moment the minority took the step which Pym had
long ago recommended to them: twenty-two Lords protested against this
postponement, saying that they would accept no responsibility for the
evil consequences which might ensue<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the Christmas which Charles I had thought to keep in the old
cheerful fashion, and the following Sunday, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1641.</span> filled with anxiety, mutual accusations, profound and violent
agitation. The apprentices at that time formed a peculiar element
of popular movements in London: since the trade ordinances of Queen
Elizabeth, which were directed to an easier administration of the
poor-law, they had been compelled to serve a long period in shops
and manufactories: though still dependent on their masters, they had
with growing years the appearance, and even the feeling, of a sort of
independence, and were specially apt at popular demonstrations. At this
moment their masters, who were agreed with the Parliament, left them to
their own devices: they prepared to go to Westminster on the following
Monday, armed with swords and pistols, chiefly to enforce the dismissal
of the hated Lunsford<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.</p>

<p>The King on the Sunday conferred with the Lord Mayor, who declared
himself powerless to check the movement: the only resource seemed to
be the withdrawal of Lunsford’s appointment; and at the Lord Mayor’s
advice the King resolved to do this. In Lunsford’s place he selected
John Byron, who also enjoyed his full confidence, without giving
occasion for such demonstrations as had been made against the other.</p>

<p>The movement was however not to be stopped thus: on the appointed day,
about the hour at which the morning sitting began, a tumultuous mob
streamed into Westminster. There they came to blows with Lunsford and
his armed followers, who were on the spot: but the demonstration told
less against him than against those members of the Upper House who had
refused to accede to the popular demand, namely the bishops. They were
received with the cry that they could be endured no longer, at any
rate in Parliament, and with insulting clamour: woe betide him who,
like Archbishop Williams, desired to obtain justice personally against
any one in the mob: he received double abuse. The hearts of some of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> temporal lords smote them at this: they
remembered their old-fashioned knightly pledge, which bound them to
defend with their swords men in long garments. The Lords actually went
to the Lower House with a prayer to this effect: the answer was that
they could not discourage the people.</p>

<p>The next day these scenes were repeated: the barges in which some
bishops sought to reach the Upper House were met with showers of
stones, and driven back from the landing-place. It seemed that the
prelates would be excluded from the house by open force: but they
themselves furnished a pretext for this being done legally. In order
to avoid any further insult, and yet not to surrender their ancient
rights, Archbishop Williams hit on the idea of assisting their cause
by a protest: he assembled eleven bishops, and induced them to sign an
instrument in which they pronounced beforehand all proceedings null
and void which should be taken during their enforced absence from
Parliament. They laid this declaration before the King and before the
Upper House, which communicated it to the Lower. This step however
produced a totally different effect from what was intended. The Commons
had a different idea of the English constitution from this meeting of
bishops: it was observed that the bishops did not in England constitute
an order whose absence would render parliamentary action invalid: their
pretensions were declared to be an attack on the fundamental laws of
Parliament and on its very existence: the Lower House impeached the
bishops of high treason for making them. They had to kneel at the
bar of the Upper House and hear the impeachment read, much to their
astonishment, for they had had no thought of doing anything improper:
they were sent to the Tower, or at any rate arrested. Thus the Commons
were suddenly relieved of these unwelcome sharers in the counsels of
Parliament: and in order to seize the favourable moment, a motion was
immediately made for their definitive exclusion from all political
affairs, nor under existing circumstances was there much doubt of its
being passed.</p>

<p>It is obvious how greatly the movement in the city helped the Puritan
party in the House of Commons, which was led by Pym and Hampden: for it
must be reckoned as at least an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> indirect result
of the tumult, that the bishops, who sought to maintain their rights
in the face of it, were, perhaps in rather a clumsy manner, removed
from the Upper House. This party united to consistency in their demands
the skill to take advantage of every error or display of weakness on
the part of their opponents. From a somewhat depressed position at the
beginning of the session they had, within two months, worked their way
up to predominant authority.</p>

<p>Nothing was wanting to their full possession of power except control
over the court and the King’s counsellors. The obvious and immediate
aim in all movements of this sort is always a change of the persons
who wield executive power, or share the secrets of its deliberations.
No one at this time possessed so much influence in both domestic and
foreign affairs as the hated Lords Bristol and Digby, father and son.
The French ambassador, who hated them as the heads of the Spanish
faction, once talked with his friends in Parliament of the necessity
for overthrowing them: he asserted that they swore to him to undertake
the attack, even though they should perish in it. So it came to pass
that formal impeachments against Digby and Bristol were proposed in
the Lower House: the father for having advised the King to put the
army into effective condition, which could only have been done with
views hostile to Parliament: the son for having accused the Commons
of encroachments on the liberties of the Lords, and on the rights of
subjects, and for having said that Parliament was no longer free.
The Lower House had this claim at any rate to supreme power, that it
already treated as a crime every expression injurious to it. The matter
advanced so far as a conference with the Lords.</p>

<p>A very widely spread idea was to proceed with an impeachment against
the Queen, as the personage who gave the most support to Catholic and
anti-Parliamentary tendencies.</p>

<p>The danger to the court arising from the influx of the mob to
Whitehall evoked counter demonstrations for its protection. A number
of officers were assembled, who had served in the old army, or were
going to Ireland. One day the court gave them a banquet at Whitehall.
Even then the intrusion of the mob could only be repelled by violence
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1641.</span> even bloodshed<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>. The apprentices
threatened to come back and take vengeance. Hereupon guards were posted
in Scotland Yard, in Westminster Abbey, in the great reception room
at Whitehall. The younger members of the gentry who were completing
their studies in the Inns of Court appeared at court, and offered
their services. They were admitted to kiss the hands of the Queen and
Prince. Never had more of the nobility been seen at court than at this
juncture: all were armed, and they went about brandishing their swords,
and showing the daggers with which they would defend the King.</p>

<p>But the presence of a company of armed men aroused again in Parliament
the fear of an intention to disperse the Houses by force. The
Parliament on its side asked for a guard; there was even a talk of
transferring the sittings into the city. A state of things had begun
which must lead to some violent explosion.</p>

<p>In the middle of December the French ambassador sent information home
that the court cabal, which he also described as Spanish, which just
then had hoped to triumph, was become weaker than the other<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>. At
the end of December he added that affairs were in greater confusion
than ever, and that Parliament was in such a position that the one
cabal or the other must perish<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII_X">CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="small">BREACH BETWEEN THE KING AND THE PARLIAMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>With the personal rivalries which the word cabal implies, there were
blended very real and weighty differences, which touched the nature of
authority itself.</p>

<p>Under the very eyes of the King the party which had compelled him
to summon a Parliament, and then wrung from him the condemnation of
Strafford and the right of Parliament not to be dissolved without its
own consent, had risen to terrible power. When he attacked it, it had
regained control of the majority in the Commons. However numerous the
minority might be, it remained excluded from all political influence.
A member was reprimanded for uttering the opinion that the majority
of the Lords and the minority of the Commons had as good right to
combine as the majority of the Commons with the minority of the
Lords<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>. Now however the majority of the Lords also was reduced to
impotence: the views of the leaders of the Commons appeared as the
opinion of Parliament. Nothing else was to be expected but that those
great demands for the abolition of Episcopacy and the co-operation
of Parliament in the appointment of all officers of state, which the
King regarded as an insult to himself, would soon be laid before him
as bills of both Houses. Yet other demands, of which we have seen the
traces at an earlier period, had now grown to full consciousness. The
Lower House had voted levies for Ireland: the question was raised
whether these could be made without a licence under the great seal,
which had always hitherto been regarded as necessary. The House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> resolved that this was not indispensable, and
that its own order was sufficient<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>. The idea had already been
suggested of not entrusting to the King the nomination of leaders
for the troops destined for Ireland: it was proposed that the Lower
House should name a lord general for the land forces, and a lord high
admiral for the fleet. In this manner they thought to fill the offices
with a couple of opposition lords, who would have had no chance in
the existing temper of the court. At the same time the men who stood
nearest to the King were attacked by an impeachment which might cost
them their lives. Who after that could join the King and manage his
affairs? Strafford was ruined because he had tried to gain for the King
a power transcending all earlier precedent: when the King surrendered
him he altered his system. Bristol and Digby are not to be compared
with Strafford in personal worth; but they belonged to the system
which the King was now determined to uphold: what was left him if he
abandoned them also?</p>

<p>The court was now trying to devise means for checking the growth of the
preponderance of Parliament; and as it was desirable to keep within
the law, none other could be found than that by which Strafford had
perished, and which had often been talked of since, the impeachment
in their turn of the leading members. There were five in the Lower
House, Pym and Hampden, the two acknowledged leaders, Hollis and
Strode, who had taken a conspicuous part in the impeachment of Digby
and Bristol, and Haslerig, who had originated the Bill of Attainder
and the proposal for the appointment of generals by Parliament. Of the
Lords they selected Mandeville, now Lord Kimbolton, chiefly because
he had been much concerned in the alliance with the Scots. The charge
which had formerly been brought against the Viceroy of Ireland, that he
had sought to overthrow the fundamental laws of England, might, they
thought, be still better imputed to those six, for they had endeavoured
to make the King hated by his people, to induce his army to abandon
him, to rob him of his authority: in fact they had already levied war
on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> King, and Parliament was kept by them in
subjection through terror and violence<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>. At least, they thought,
they could support all these charges with no slighter evidence than had
availed to prove the accusation against Strafford: why should these
men not be convicted of high treason as well as Strafford? Moreover
they would be under arrest during the process, and so for a long time
be rendered harmless. It was determined that the impeachment should be
laid before the Lords immediately in the King’s name.</p>

<p>It has often been proved to demonstration that this step cannot be
regarded as lawful. The Upper House possessed no criminal jurisdiction
over the Lower: the charges against the five members ought to have
been brought before a grand jury, or before the Commons themselves.
We may add that there was a misunderstanding of what had happened
in Stafford’s case. The Lord Lieutenant was not condemned at all in
judicial form: his condemnation was a political act of the legislative
authority. The Lower House, from which it proceeded, had since gone
still further in the same direction, and the Upper House was now
paralysed: the impeachment embraced charges against the majority which
now enjoyed the whole authority of Parliament. It was bringing the
authors of the imputed crime to trial before their accomplices, for
a large part of the Upper House belonged to the same party. To what
result could this lead?</p>

<p>On January 3, 1642, the Attorney-General, by special command of the
King, laid the impeachment before the Lords, where it was received with
astonishment. The arrest even of the member of their own House was not
ordered, nor even notice of motion given. But just as if all had been
fully completed, royal officers immediately repaired to the houses
of the accused members of the Lower House to seal up their papers.
The Commons were in the act of taking counsel for the indispensable
security of the great council of the nation, when the news of this
measure arrived. They declared it a breach of their privileges,
especially as there had not even been notice given them of the
impeachment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> called on the Upper House for
joint resistance: just then appeared the King’s serjeant to require the
surrender of the five members. The Commons had no intention of giving
way to this demand, but could not at the moment pronounce a definite
refusal. The House pledged itself that the members should at all times
be ready to answer any lawful impeachment which should be brought
against them, but at the same time reserved the power of representing
to the King by a deputation, that this matter touched the privileges of
Parliament, and concerned the whole Commons of the realm.</p>

<p>The five members were not arrested, and the seals which had been
affixed to their dwellings were removed by an order of the Lower House,
in which the Lords concurred.</p>

<p>In earlier times kings had arrested without difficulty members who had
opposed them. Charles I had surrendered this power when he accepted
the Petition of Right: but we may remember that the lawyers had then
secretly assured him that it would always remain to him in case of
need. Besides, in cases of treason, privileges counted for nothing.
Always inclined to interfere in person, the King determined to go
himself to the Lower House, and obtain the surrender of the accused,
which had been denied to his officers. It is asserted that he took
counsel on the question with members of the Privy Council who also had
seats in Parliament, and that his intention was approved by them<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.</p>

<p>It is clear as day that by so doing the King attacked the immunities
on which Parliament founded its efficiency and its very existence. It
determined under no circumstances to permit the arrest. An immediate
practical importance now attached to that protest which had been
passed after the discovery of the army plot, and which formed a
sort of English Covenant, and pledged every man to defend by united
effort the privileges of Parliament. In relation to this the formal
resolution was passed that in case any one, whoever it might be,
should attempt to arrest a member of the House without its assent and
order, resistance should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> made to him. The
question was raised whether the refusal to allow the arrest should
be made unconditionally<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>: and not only was this answered in the
affirmative, but a further step was taken. As the King again refused
the renewed pressure for the appointment of a guard for Parliament, the
Lower House now, without further hesitation, requested the Lord Mayor
to arm the militia, and send a detachment of them to Westminster to
protect the assembly. It looked as if it might serve also as a defence
against the violent arrest of the members. The King commanded the Lord
Mayor to assemble no troops without his positive order, and if any riot
took place in the city, to suppress it by force of arms. He himself
deferred the execution of his purpose till the next day (January 4).
His plan was, so to speak, a public secret. In the morning the Earl of
Essex, Lord Chamberlain, informed the five members confidentially that
the King was coming to seize their persons<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. This was known at the
commencement of the sitting. The vehemence of the debate was however
not damped by this news, but rather stimulated: especially it dealt
with the act of impeachment, which was attacked at all points, refuted,
denounced, and finally declared to be a scandalous libel, whose authors
must be detected and punished, in order to secure the Commonwealth
against them. It was as if the Lower House wished to answer the King’s
threat by a counter threat of its own. Hitherto Charles I had delayed
the execution of his design. At the news of this resolution he felt
himself as it were challenged: in violent agitation he went to the
officers assembled in the antechamber. ‘Soldiers,’ he cried, ‘vassals,
let him who is true to me, follow me<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>!’ They hastened with him down
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> stairs: at the door there was by chance a
carriage which the King entered, the multitude following him on foot.</p>

<p>In St. Stephen’s Chapel the afternoon sitting had just begun, when
Captain Langres, probably sent by the French ambassador, arrived with
the tidings that the King was on his way from Whitehall<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. The
danger was imminent for all, inasmuch as they had pledged themselves
to resist a violent capture of the members, who were present. It was
now thought good to adopt the advice which Lord Essex had given in
the morning: and a resolution was passed that the five members should
withdraw, to which Strode, the youngest of them, offered strenuous
opposition, for he wished to seal his innocence with his blood.
Scarcely were they gone when the King arrived. His armed followers,
amounting to about five hundred men, lined the way for him as he
entered. He bade them stay in the vestibule, forbidding any of them to
enter the chamber on pain of death: the Earl of Roxburgh kept the door.
Charles I had no idea of dispersing the assembly by force, after the
fashion of more decidedly revolutionary times. Extraordinary as his
conduct was, he believed himself to be acting within his legal rights,
and only wished to make his prerogative effectual. The prerogative
of the crown in the sense of the early kings, and the privilege of
Parliament in the sense of coming times, were directly contradictory to
each other. The King was attended by the Elector Palatine: uncovered,
saluting on both sides, he walked up to the Speaker’s chair. He said
that he did not wish to interfere with the privilege of the House, but
that it did not apply in cases of treason: as he had waited in vain
yesterday for the surrender of those accused of this crime, he had
now come in person to take them away. He asked first for Pym—all was
silent: then for Hollis—still no answer. He turned to the Speaker, to
learn from him where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> were: the Speaker
fell on his knee and prayed to be excused if he was silent, he was but
the organ of the House, and had no eyes to see, nor tongue to speak,
anything but what the House bade him. The King now perceived for
himself that those whom he sought were not present, or, as he himself
expressed it, that the birds were flown. He seized the occasion to
assure the House that he intended no violence, that he would observe
all that he had granted for the good of his subjects, and that he would
proceed in strictly legal fashion against the accused, but that he
expected an answer, else he would know how to seek and to find them.
He departed in the same manner in which he had entered, but already it
might be seen what lay hidden under this crust of forced moderation.
From the assembly was heard the cry of Privilege! whereupon the King’s
guards laid hand on their swords, and drew out their loaded pistols.</p>

<p>As the five members of the Lower House had fled to the city, the King
next day, holding firmly to his purpose, repaired to Guildhall to
obtain their surrender. The aldermen and common council were assembled.
Charles had all the less hesitation about trusting himself among them,
because he was assured of the devotion of the city authorities: only,
as we know, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were no longer masters of
the populace. In presence of the King was raised the cry, Privilege!
Liberty of Parliament! to this others answered with God bless the
King! They were the battle-cries of the opposing parties: no one could
say which was the stronger among those present<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>. When peace was
restored, the King himself, by asking whether any one had anything
to say, as it were invited a demonstration. A voice called out that
the assembly wished the King to listen to the opinion of Parliament:
another replied that the speaker expressed his own sentiments only, not
those of the assembly. ‘Who can say,’ interposed the King, ‘that I do
not listen to the advice of my Parliament? but there is a difference
between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> Parliament and some turbulent members
of it: the one I do and will listen to, the others I will deliver over
to lawful punishment.’</p>

<p>When the King was gone, his demand raised a hot debate: it was not
directly refused, but at the same time it was not acceded to.</p>

<p>The King, who wished to show himself in his fashion gracious and
confiding, had invited himself to dine with one of the aldermen. When
he quitted the house the crowd which had gathered meanwhile received
him with the cry, ‘Parliament! Privilege!’ and here it was not as
in the common council, for there was no counter shout. A pamphlet
was thrown into the King’s carriage with the title, ‘To thy tents, O
Israel’—the words with which Israel rose against Rehoboam. The King
however would not even now abandon his object. The next day appeared
a prohibition to receive and harbour the five fugitive members. His
officers and all his subjects were required to seize them, and commit
them to the Tower, which was now in safe hands: the King at this moment
had some cannon conveyed thither, and strengthened the garrison. What
might not be expected after this<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>?</p>

<p>On one of these days a friend writes to Admiral Pennington: we have
here no fewer storms than you have at sea, and perhaps even worse and
more dangerous. We are here near to ruin, says another letter: the
liberty of the press, the factious preaching, the licence which unruly
people have assumed of assembling without regard to the laws, all
this has destroyed obedience to the King as with a slow poison. The
Puritan faction, it is observed in a third letter, together with the
schismatics, are so strong in the city and country, that no one can
foresee the result, unless the King and Parliament are reconciled.</p>

<p>This however was now become impossible. The Commons met the
unsuccessful steps of the King with the most determined and vigorous
opposition. Already on January 5 they had resolved to adjourn the
sittings at Westminster till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> the 11th, as
they could not attend to business in safety there, so long as their
violated privileges were not re-established, and meanwhile to appoint
a committee, which should sit at Guildhall, and before everything else
devise means for the restoration of security<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. On the 6th we find
this committee already at Guildhall: a deputation of the common council
in their chains and gowns of office welcomed their appearance. The
first decision of the committee was, that the impeachment of the five
members was illegal, and a breach of the privileges of Parliament. On
this was based the second, in opposition to the King’s new order of
arrest, that whosoever should attempt to obey it should be treated as
an open enemy of the commonwealth. But if all that had been attempted
against the five members was declared unlawful, there was no ground
for depriving them of their share in the proceedings. On January 7 in
Grocer’s Hall, for the common council could no longer spare the room
at Guildhall, the committee resolved to summon back the five accused
members to its deliberations, without regard to the King’s decree. Thus
the deputation representing Parliament included in its own body the
men whom the King designated as traitors, and in so doing had the full
support of the capital. In the common council, through the influence of
the newly elected members, even before they had formally taken their
seats, the party opposed to the King had now the upper hand: the notion
was fully accepted that the city was pledged to defend Parliament
and its privileges. The common council appointed a committee, which,
in concert with that of the Commons, resolved, on the ground of the
attempts that had been made, to form a guard for defence against them.
The city thought it necessary to take precautions for its safety
against such a commandant of the Tower as John Byron; it was determined
to raise an armed force under an officer in whom Parliament and the
city should have full confidence. Such a leader they found in Captain
Skippon, a man of Puritan opinions and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>
supporter of the Parliament, who had learned war in Holland, and had
raised himself from the lowest rank: he was placed as major-general at
the head of a guard, at first of eight companies, which was immediately
formed in the city and its neighbourhood. No one was admitted into
it who had not taken the oath of protest. And without scruple they
faced the possibility of thus coming to open war with the King. In the
seventh article of the resolution Skippon was expressly authorised to
attack as well as defend, in case violence was offered to him: and
this service, said the twelfth article, was to be counted as legal,
and as rendered to the King, the kingdom, and Parliament—for so long
as it was in any way feasible they observed forms. The sitting of the
10th was the first in which the five members again took part: we see
what an importance its conclusions had. Nor were they contented with
this alliance between Parliament and the city: they accepted an offer
made by Hampden in the name of some thousands of his Buckinghamshire
constituents, to live and die in defence of the rights of the Lower
House. Thus completely did the impeachment of the five members, in
which Charles I thought to find deliverance and safety, and his attempt
to seize them, result in his discomfiture.</p>

<p>The King held his conduct to be valid and lawful: Parliament declared
it in the highest degree unlawful, both the scheme itself and every
separate step. We will not undertake to decide this controversy, but we
may remark that it touched the very core of the pending questions. All
the claims of the Lower House depended on its representing the commons
of the country. As the individuality of the members would be shown in
the discharge of this high duty, so it was protected by the very idea.
The House which for ages has maintained a certain jurisdiction for the
preservation of internal order, is alone possessed of the right to
judge of the misdeeds of its members within its precincts, or even of
the charges which are brought against them. Without this an external
power would be able to interfere with the conditions of its internal
action, or directly to disperse it by repeated accusations and arrests.
The assembly forms a moral person, which alone acts, so long as it is
in session: only if it assents and surrenders its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1642.</span> members, can they be brought to justice. On this foundation
depend its privileges: the members are thereby raised personally above
their natural position as subjects.</p>

<p>On the other hand the King maintained that the entire supreme power,
and the care for the general interests, were entrusted to his hands. In
cases which implied a danger to the whole state, he would on no account
abandon the right of arrest in order to prevent such dangers. Every
day’s experience showed that this power was exercised in the great
neighbouring monarchies without any reserve whatever, and powerfully
contributed to their strength and stability. Now, as before, Charles
I regarded members of Parliament merely as his subjects, and would
exercise the inherent rights of his office against them as well as
others. What he now treated as a crime in them was the attitude of
political hostility which they maintained; he thought to be able to
punish it as treason against the crown. The Parliament on the contrary
saw in every infringement of their inviolability an attack on the
institutions of the country: to have taken part in them it declared to
be treason<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.</p>

<p>The King succumbed in this contest chiefly because the capital,
carried away by the religious sympathies of the populace, sided with
the Parliament; deeming itself pledged to protect the privileges of
Parliament, whatever sense might be put on them by Parliament. The
armed force which it might have been expected that the King would raise
for himself, received, under the guidance of the city, an impulse
against him.</p>

<p>He had gone back to Whitehall, as has been said, thinking the city
was favourable to him. When nothing but hostility and contempt was
displayed towards him from thence, he could not wish to remain longer
in the neighbourhood. Moreover the Queen found her stay unendurable.
She one day called the attention of the Dutch ambassador to certain
persons whose presence in the palace was not to be avoided, but who,
she said, were there merely to spy her actions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1642.</span> those of the King. Her oldest friends of both sexes were in
this category: the most detested of all was the French ambassador, her
brother’s representative. There seemed also to be danger if Parliament,
as was reported, came back to Westminster with the civic guard, there
being no means for repelling an attack on the palace. The Queen thought
that the least she had to fear was being separated from the King<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>.
Under these circumstances the King and Queen resolved to quit
Whitehall: they first returned to Hampton Court, though no preparation
had been made there for their reception, and soon afterwards, not
feeling safe enough there, repaired to Windsor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sittings in the Lower House had been resumed on the
appointed day amid great popular rejoicings. Two or three thousand
mounted yeomen had come in: the sailors of the Thames occupied the
river with numerous barges: the militia and guards were drawn up in
their ranks: the young men from the stalls and workshops appeared with
flags and pikes, and poles on which printed inscriptions announced
their troth and devotion to the laws, liberty, and religion. Then the
Committee, which hitherto had sat in the city, with the five members
and Lord Kimbolton, entered a boat at the Three Cranes, which was
joined by a great number of others: amid salutes of artillery and
hearty congratulations they were conducted back towards Whitehall hard
by. The King had fled: the chamber occupied by the Commons might be
regarded as the supreme seat of authority.</p>

<p>A momentary embarrassment may have been caused, through the nature of
the parliamentary forms, by the King’s having departed. But it was
already usual, at least on one side, to require obedience to decrees
issuing from the Lower House only. In order to obviate the counter
effects of the King’s personal commands, they devised the formula that
only those orders of the King which should be issued with assent of
both Houses, were to be fulfilled. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>
used, so far as I can discover, for the first time in the nomination
of Skippon: his dismissal could only be effected by a royal order
expressed through the two houses, that is to say, not by the King’s
command but according to the opinion of the houses. On a similar
principle the commandants of the chief places received instructions to
admit no reinforcement of their garrisons without a royal order backed
by the assent of both houses.</p>

<p>Immediately after the resumption of its sittings, Parliament renewed
its complaints about the bad advisers of the King, about the favour
shown to evil-minded persons, and the neglect which others experienced:
but it now went further than ever before. A commission appointed to
consider ways and means for the restoration of peace reported that the
greatest of all evils was ‘the influence which recusants, priests, and
other malignants have over the Queen, the influence which these possess
in the State, the great influence which she has over the King.’ It is
obvious that nothing would content the Parliament but an administration
composed entirely of their partisans, and the absolute subordination to
it of all personal authority.</p>

<p>There was no longer a word of any opposition from the House of Lords.
Energetic expressions employed there against the proposals of the
Commons sufficed to give rise to a formal accusation against them. One
day, after an unsatisfactory conference with the Lords, Pym declared
that the Commons would be very well content to have their help in
saving the country, but if not they were determined to do their duty
alone: but surely it would not come to be recorded in history that the
Lords at a time of so great danger had taken no part in saving the
country. Through various concurrent circumstances it came to pass that
what had been the minority of the Lords now constituted the majority.
The Upper House, on February 5, assented to the bill by which the
bishops were deprived of their voice in Parliament.</p>

<p>To change the administration and overthrow the bishops was the
purpose which the majority of the Lower House had pursued since the
commencement of the new session. The last contest had broken out
because the King would not give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> way on these
points. After this battle had been decided, and the King defeated,
nothing else was to be expected than that Parliament would proceed
without further hesitation to accomplish its purpose. It had already
taken care to have an armed force at command for the maintenance of the
position it had won.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But to what had the British monarchy of the Stuarts been reduced! Its
aim was to form the three kingdoms into an union which should consult
the interests of all equally. The prerogative of royalty by the
grace of God, and Episcopacy, were to form the foundations of public
power, and peace abroad serve to maintain tranquillity at home. Not
unsuccessfully the first Stuart supported this system which originated
in his own brain, more by a clever and versatile management of affairs
according to the circumstances of the moment, which he moulded to his
will with tenacious perseverance, than through great qualities which
might have availed to bind men’s hearts to his cause, or institutions
which might have given it independent permanence. The system had not
strength to bear the test of a war, in which the second Stuart let
himself be entangled, and Great Britain remained far below the rank
which properly belonged to her. At home the war was a signal for all
contending elements to show themselves. Charles I was by nature at once
lawyer-like and priest-like, deeply convinced that the doctrines which
he believed, the rights which he claimed, were true and pleasing to
God, and (after the precedent of ‘his wise father’) that both possessed
intrinsic power. His opponents were in his eyes the enemies of the
cause of God, which was also his own, and which he was born to defend.
Of the rights of others he had little understanding, and but a slight
opinion of their strength, as if they did not much signify so long as
external order lasted. Then it came to pass that through action and
reaction this order was broken through at the most vulnerable point.
The policy in which the King saw a divine necessity, and the safety and
future greatness of Great Britain, was regarded by the greater portion
of his subjects as violence and oppression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>
at home, weakness abroad, and inclination towards a system detested
by them, which was just then threatening the world with subjection.
Then the Scots rose, with the strong effort of a long-suppressed
religious and national impulse: the idea of independence for their
Church spread to the State also. While the King was preparing to master
this opposition with the strength of England, the latter also rose in
analogous opposition to him. He was obliged to restore Parliament, with
which, during the war, he had been fundamentally at variance, after
having long avoided it: Parliament claimed its primitive rights in
their fullest extent, and would assent to nothing but an unmistakeably
Protestant policy. In the course of this struggle the native enthusiasm
of the Irish also rose in arms, to cast off the subjection in which
they were held by the superior power of the Protestant and Teutonic
element.</p>

<p>Charles I was not formed by nature to wage such a war successfully:
he was not fully master of his own court and council, which was full
of cabals in which foreign powers took part, in the very year of this
contest. While he only took counsel with his partisans, he could not
prevent some of them from acting with an eye to their own particular
interests, which made others adopt the opposite view with embittered
pertinacity. He himself was always occupied with his own intentions;
the purposes, strength, and probable acts of his opponents he had not
the penetration to measure: we see him with the utmost confidence
undertaking what was to the last degree ruinous. With this was united
a false wisdom: for the sake of some greater end he would assent to
things which in-themselves he disapproved. Then when his ultimate views
came again to light, beside those which for the moment he had admitted,
he appeared in himself untrue and untrustworthy: his opponents held
themselves justified in taking security by any means against his
returning to his old intentions. His adversaries on the other hand,
were consistent, vigilant, and suspicious: in opposition to the notion
of a compact power, not weak in itself, but merely represented as
such, and always dreaded, they placed the feelings of provincial and
constitutional autonomy, which, when once penetrated by the feelings
and ideas of individual freedom, disclosed an invincible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1642.</span> strength. Thus it came to pass that one of the British
kingdoms attained to an independence which robbed the crown of all
substantial influence: the second was striving to conquer by a bloody
insurrection, stained with horrible crimes, the same independence
for its Catholic population which was enjoyed in the first by the
Protestants: while in the third and greatest an authority was being
established which aimed at absorbing the royal power.</p>

<p>The course of events had virtually decided that the original system
of the Stuarts could not be established: but what shape the British
kingdoms would assume, whether they would hold together or separate,
what forms and principles of government would ultimately triumph,—all
this lay buried in total darkness.</p>

<p>England had not stopped at the constitutional questions which
presuppose an assured social order. We have more than once remarked
on the significance of the attempt to overthrow Episcopacy, which
formed one of the fundamental conditions of English society, and of the
constitution. This had been done earlier still in Scotland, though not
without serious danger, in the first stage of the Reformation movement,
in which the truth of doctrines and the salvation of men’s souls were
at stake. It was otherwise in England, where doctrines in general
were undisputed, and the episcopal order, which was most intimately
connected with the doctrine, had the deepest root in the nation. That
Parliament thought to destroy and uproot this order is, among all its
undertakings, the one which most distinctly bore the character of
revolution—for where should destruction once begun find an end?—and
of one-sided party violence. To the King it was in a measure useful,
for by opposing it he regained a tenable position and the possibility
of resistance. He could now with obvious truth retort on his opponents
the charge which they had made against him, of seeking to overthrow the
laws of England. Charles could assert that he would never permit any
alteration in the lawful condition of England. ‘Nolumus leges Angliae
mutari’ was firmer ground for him than the indefinite and questionable
rights of prerogative, which at an earlier time he had sought to
maintain and extend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>

<p>No words are needed to show the universal historical importance of
these contests in Great Britain; both the purely constitutional ones,
and those extending into the domain of revolution, of whose development
we have undertaken to treat. It was our object to watch the origin of
them on this classic ground of all constitutional history. It is an
event which concerns all, this shaking of the foundations of the old
British state. Whether they would stand the shock, or, if not, what
shape public affairs would in that case assume, was a question which
must concern the Continent also; the civilised world is still busy day
by day with more or less conspicuous complications of the spiritual and
political struggles arising from similar opposing principles.</p>

<p>In the states of Western Europe constitutional rights from a very
early date had contended for the mastery against the supreme executive
authority: but this strife assumed a new character, as to the
principles involved and the system on which it was waged, from the
date when the spiritual questions raised by religious controversy
came to be mixed up with those purely political. In this respect
creed made no difference. Starting from the demand for ecclesiastical
uniformity, the French earliest of all sought, under the impulse of
Catholic fanaticism, to confine their government within the narrowest
limits in the sphere of politics also. In the year 1576 the Estates at
Blois asked the assent of the crown to the resolutions passed by them:
they wanted to exclude from the Privy Council all members hostile to
them. In 1585 the Guises at the head of the Catholic League proposed
assemblies of the Estates, recurring regularly every three years, which
should keep a reckoning between prince and people. The chief among
several grievances which roused the population of Paris to insurrection
against Henry III was the tolerance accorded to the Huguenots in
contravention of the old laws of the land. In the assembly of 1588 the
Estates formulated the demand that the King not only should administer
the finances with their co-operation, but also should in future neither
declare war nor conclude peace without them. In the assembly of 1593
they proceeded to dispose of the crown itself: the doctrine was, that
if the King disregarded the fundamental laws of his kingdom, namely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
the spiritual laws, his authority reverted to those by whom it had been
conferred, that is to say, the Estates. It was only the departure of
Henry III from the capital, and the military exploits of Henry IV, that
preserved the personal authority of the French kings.</p>

<p>We may perceive at a glance the manifold analogies between the English
events of which we are now treating, and those which had taken place
in France half a century earlier. Both began through a desire to make
the recognition of the exclusive dominance of one religion effectively
binding on a government not decidedly inclined to that party: in
both the one-sided tolerance displayed by the princes formed one of
the chief grounds of complaint against them: the demand was not only
for the full execution of the ecclesiastical laws, but also for the
unconditional validity of the resolutions passed by the assembly of
the Estates wherein these opinions prevailed, for periodic meetings of
the Estates, and the dependence on them of the highest officials and
of the entire administration—with this difference, that what in the
one kingdom was desired for the benefit of Catholicism, in the other
was meant to aid the Protestant cause. The religious principles were
opposed to one another, the political were to a large extent identical.</p>

<p>In England however all was more deeply rooted and more firmly
established than in France. The preponderance of Parliament was far
more a matter of historical usage than the power of the Three Estates
in France: it had grown up in far more intimate union with the feelings
and habits of men. Further, while in France the motives derived from
foreign connexions occupied the whole foreground, and were as clear
as daylight, in England such motives were weaker and more obscure:
the movement assumed a prevailing national colour. When at last after
long disputes every chance of a peaceful result had vanished, it was
obvious that in England the war must involve far greater danger to the
crown. From the different development of the contending principles in
the two countries arose the divergence in their later history. At that
time the English crown was not yet without military resources, and the
example of France might serve as an encouragement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span> to challenge the
fortunes of war on the King’s behalf. The English capital had taken as
active a part in favour of the Puritan Parliament as the French capital
for the exclusively Catholic Estates. Charles I had been obliged to
quit Westminster and London as Henry III had quitted Paris: since the
successor of the latter had within a few years made himself master of
Paris, and had brought about a reaction at least in politics, might not
the same future be possible for Charles I also?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX_I">CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="small">ORIGIN OF THE CIVIL WAR.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There is an important point of connexion between English and French
history in the fact that the Queen of England was a daughter of Henry
IV, and had her father ever in view as the ideal man and prince.
She had grown up under the influence of those prevailing Catholic
sentiments which her Florentine mother favoured, and in ideas of the
unconditional supremacy of royalty and of the claims of birth, such as
had come into favour under her brother: almost more than he she showed
that the blood of Henry IV flowed in her veins.</p>

<p>We know how long it was before she could obtain any certain influence
over her husband. He put an end, with a decision which no one would
have expected in him, to the religious demonstrations of her household,
of which she approved: he allowed no scope to her personal sympathies,
which were directed across the Channel; he supported his ministers
against her. For Charles I was fully conscious of his royal calling: he
would not let his position be interfered with by foreign influences:
only in cases of mercy was the Queen’s intercession ever attended to.
Hostility to Cardinal Richelieu, who had deeply offended both the Queen
through her mother and the King by his connexion with the Scots gave
the first occasion for an understanding between Charles and his consort
which was of importance in public affairs; it formed as it were a
common interest between them.</p>

<p>The Queen reconciled herself to the dominion of Anglicanism, while
it supported the prerogative, on which again toleration of the
Catholics was based. Hence also attacks on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>
prerogative, the unconditional validity of which had been assumed in
her marriage treaty, appeared to her like an assault on her personal
rights. She had that fiery conviction of the truth of her creed which
is frequently characteristic of clever women: they see in every
deviation from it either error, or a wicked design, or actual crime:
the feeling of being in the true faith fills them with pride and utter
contempt for its enemies. How much more must this have been the case
where religious hostility was in league with political attacks on the
rights of royalty. In the efforts of the Puritan party in Parliament
Henrietta Maria saw so many blows aimed at all human and divine rights.
She had not yet fully converted her husband to these views, but she
impressed him by her quick, spirited, and lively intelligence: events
aroused in her a far more active spirit of resistance than in him:
she divined the purport of the intentions of her opponents, and the
inevitable results of the steps taken by the King. The fact that her
views and predictions were justified by the event, gave her a double
influence over him, so that he formed a very high opinion of her
talents. Long as they had been married, she had never lost the traces
of passionate affection: once, though half jestingly, she showed signs
of a nascent jealousy: but the King wished to please her and go hand
in hand with her; as her penetration convinced him, so too he loved
to win her approval. Her judgment was especially decisive in personal
matters: she boasted once that as soon as she had gained credit with
the King, she had restored to his favour persons whom before he
had hated<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>. Now however the bitterest hatred of Parliament was
directed against all whom she favoured or listened to. Persons, at
least as much as principles, were the great exciting cause of the
movement<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>. The Queen herself was directly attacked and threatened
by this hostility. To arm against the Parliament was for her a matter
at once of self-defence and of ambition; she aroused for this end all
the energy which the King possessed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> Charles
I desired to defend not merely himself but also his wife and family.
In this community of interests, of opinions, and of dangers, the Queen
obtained, if not absolute dominion, at any rate the greatest influence
over the King.</p>

<p>Her fear lest they should be separated had contributed mainly, as we
have seen, to their joint resolve to quit London. There was however in
this no despondency: the court merely wished to save itself from being
coerced by the immediate pressure of the mob: the plan of taking up
arms and threatening the city itself was connected with this removal.</p>

<p>Parliament was greatly disturbed by the news that the officers and
armed men who had been dispersed from Westminster had reassembled at
Windsor. Digby told them that the King had retired from the city in
order to avoid being trampled on. He himself appeared in the field
at the head of a small body of men with his friend Lunsford, and was
suspected of intending to seize Kingston-on-Thames. It may safely
be assumed that this suspicion was well founded. Some months later
the Queen frankly told a French agent that the purpose of herself
and the King had been to seize, from Windsor, a strong place in the
neighbourhood, but that this had become impossible when the Parliament
placed troops between that point and the castle<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. These were the
militia of Surrey and Bucks, who were immediately despatched, and
dispersed the royal troops before they had fairly assembled. Lunsford
was brought back a prisoner: the subtle Digby escaped.</p>

<p>From Kingston, where there was a considerable magazine, the King would
have been able to communicate with Portsmouth and Hull, as well as with
the Tower. The attention of the Queen was especially directed towards
Hull, where there was a great store of arms, enough, as was supposed,
for an army of sixteen thousand men: but the project of making an
immediate attempt upon that town was frustrated, as far as we can see,
by the opposition of members of the Privy Council,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1642.</span> who feared by such a step to provoke the Parliament to arms,
with which they still wished to maintain a tolerable understanding<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>.</p>

<p>The Queen was of an entirely different opinion: she held that the only
way to arrive at an accommodation was first to come to a distinct
breach; that only when the King had definitely opposed himself to
Parliament would he find the means for resistance.</p>

<p>If however the court had no strong places at its command, the Queen
could not stay in the country. She did not feel safe in any of the
country houses and badly fortified castles which were at her disposal:
she was afraid of falling some day into the hands of Parliament, a
prospect which seemed to her both disgraceful and dangerous. The idea
of her leaving the country for some time, which had often been thought
of before, was now again mooted: there was a further reason, as she
said, in the fact that her presence irritated Parliament against the
King. Still a regard for her own safety and for the King’s negotiations
was by no means the only reason for her departure: when the Queen
fled, as undoubtedly she did, before enemies who were too strong to
be faced, she hoped at the same time to be able to provide the means
requisite for their overthrow. She resolved to conduct her daughter to
the house of her future father-in-law, who would be greatly obliged
thereby, for he had already through his ambassadors expressed a wish
that this should be done, and would afford her support. She had jewels
with her, including some left by Queen Elizabeth, and intended to sell
them, or pawn them as security for the loan she hoped to raise: and she
thought that with the arms to be purchased with the proceeds, or with
the money in cash, her husband would be in a position to declare war
if necessary. He promised her not to depart without her knowledge from
the resolutions which they had adopted together, and especially to make
no further concessions to Parliament. Prince Rupert of the Palatinate
had already come to Dover with the purpose of taking arms in his
uncle’s cause. He was told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> that the time was
not yet come, and accompanied the Queen to Holland: but at Dover men
spoke without any reserve of the probabilities of war within a short
time<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.</p>

<p>All hope of an accommodation was not yet given up: the negotiations
had not been altogether broken off by the King’s departure from
the capital: on both sides they still thought it possible to avoid
extremities.</p>

<p>On one of the most important questions there had been some
approximation. The King had at last agreed to what the Lords, after
the violent transformation of their house, had by a majority accepted:
he prevailed upon himself to sanction the exclusion of the bishops
from their temporal offices, and especially from Parliament. He had
two motives for this; first, that otherwise the departure of his Queen
would not have been permitted; secondly, that he saw no other means
of saving the existence of the bishops in their spiritual character,
the episcopal church government, which the opposition intended to
destroy. He regarded Episcopacy as a divine institution which he durst
not overthrow: but he held it to be allowable to surrender under
the pressure of circumstances, he hoped not for ever, the temporal
authority which had been committed to the bishops.</p>

<p>Even on the other great dispute, which was now prominent, concerning
the chief control of the military power, the King had shown some signs
of giving way. When towards the end of January he was urged to entrust
the fortresses, as well as the command of the militia, only to persons
whom the two Houses of Parliament should have recommended to him, he
answered with much emphasis that the appointment of military commanders
was one of the jewels of the crown that could not be parted with: but
he added that he wished to know the names of the men in whom Parliament
had confidence, as well as the extent of the power which they thought
to confer, and the length of time for which it should be held. Such
concessions were scarcely expected, and awakened in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1642.</span> the country a lively hope that all might even yet be amicably
settled<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>. What was the point at which this hope broke down?</p>

<p>Immediately after the King’s return from Dover to Greenwich the list
of persons recommended, as well as details of the power intended for
them, and its duration, were laid before him. In the names he found
not much to object to: about the extent of power he raised some legal
difficulties, which however might very well have been removed: but he
was only the more resolute in his resistance to the terms suggested
as to its duration. Parliament claimed exclusively for itself the
right of revoking the appointments, as well as authority to punish
any disobedience to its ordinance<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. The King however had never
intended to go so far. He might very likely have been persuaded to
temporary compliance: as the scheme stood, it implied his renunciation
for ever of all military authority. To this Charles I would not assent,
declaring in the most emphatic language that he could not entrust to
others the power placed in his hands by God, through the laws, for the
defence of his people, at all events without being able at any moment
to resume it. All now depended on whether Parliament would be content
with this limitation.</p>

<p>There were not wanting some in the assembly who would have been
satisfied with this, as the control of the army had always been a right
of the crown. But what security would there have been in appointing
military commanders whose powers might be taken from them by the
King at any moment. The debate filled many with gloom and fear of
misfortune<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>. Whatever they might do, whether they remained quiet,
or regulated the militia under the authority of the two Houses, matters
had come to a crisis, ‘to a desperate pass.’ In the Lower House the
determination to adhere to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> their purpose, and
consideration of their own danger prevailed. They first resolved that
the King’s answer must be regarded as a positive refusal, and then
agreed upon a new memorial, in which he was told plainly, that unless
he declared himself ready to satisfy Parliament on this point, and
that at once, through the members who presented the memorial, they
had determined to take control of the militia under the authority of
the two Houses, and the words were added, ‘for the rescue of the King
himself and of his kingdom.’</p>

<p>Charles I replied that he was astonished at this message: his answer
had contained all that he could grant in reason, justice, and honour.
After a few days Lord Pembroke once more put the question, whether he
would not, at least for a short time, surrender to Parliament the right
of control over the army. The King answered, not for an hour: things
had been demanded of him which had never before been asked of a King.
He was now against any temporary concession.</p>

<p>Parliament however paid no further attention to him. They adhered to
the fiction that the agreement of the two Houses implied the royal
will, even when the King in person had in the most decided manner
expressed an opposite view. After receiving his answer the Lower
House passed a resolution that the kingdom should immediately be put
into a state of defence under the authority of Parliament, in the
manner already fixed (March 2). Some few lords of ancient name, such
as Lindsay, Grey, Seymour, Capel, offered some resistance: but the
majority agreed to the conclusions of the Lower House, and action was
taken immediately according to their tenour.</p>

<p>The King was on his way to the North, when he received a declaration
stating the reasons for these resolutions: he did not delay a moment
the issue of a counter declaration (Huntingdon, 15 March) in which he
repeated the contents of his last message; at the same time he called
attention to the fundamental laws of the realm, one of which was
that no subject was bound to pay obedience to any act or command to
which the King had not given his consent. He stated that he required
obedience to the existing laws, and simply forbade any compliance with
orders not ratified by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> himself; both generally,
and in special relation to the army, no ordinance was to be carried out
in which he had no part<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. He did not stop, it will be seen, at the
immediate circumstances of the case, but raised conspicuously the great
constitutional question which Parliament had decided for itself, or
treated as if already decided.</p>

<p>The Parliament was not misled on either point: this time the majority
of the Upper House took the initiative. On the evening of the 16th
arrived the message from Huntingdon: on the evening of the 17th first
the Lords and then the Commons adopted the resolutions, first, to
adhere to their earlier declarations in relation to the army<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>,
secondly, that the Lords and Commons in Parliament possessed the full
right of declaring what the law of the land was, and that to dispute or
deny this, or to issue an order that any such declaration was not to
be attended to, was a breach of the privileges of Parliament. Whoever
advised the King, added the Lower House, to send this message, is an
enemy to the peace of the kingdom.</p>

<p>This is the moment, if we would fix it exactly, at which reconciliation
between the King and the Parliament became impossible. Hitherto
the opposing manifestoes had always assumed the possibility of a
reconciliation, although they obviously risked a different result: but
the gulf between the King’s declaration on the 15th, and the answer
of Parliament on the 17th, could not be bridged over: the two powers
now stood most distinctly opposed to each other, both in their general
claims and in their specific demands. The latter in fact implied the
former: they formed a kind of summary of the whole dispute.</p>

<p>From this point the dissension, which hitherto had been confined to
the constitutional authorities, spread over a wider field. King and
Parliament together had formed the authority which every one was bound
to obey: what was to happen when these issued contrary orders? The
question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> to which of the two they would render
obedience was set first before the commandants of certain fortresses.</p>

<p>In the first days after the King’s departure, when Digby and Lunsford
were stirring, it was remarked in the city that arms and ammunition
were being brought out of the Tower, and an unusual quantity of
provisions carried in. Not only was this immediately forbidden, but
also, in order to make it impossible, a levy of militia, under the
command of Skippon, was stationed in the approaches to the Tower, and
information immediately conveyed to the Common Council. The Lieutenant
Constable, John Byron, was greatly astonished when the Sheriffs of
London and Middlesex informed him of this arrangement. He declared
to them that it ran counter to the privileges of the Tower, which he
had received orders from the King to maintain. They referred to the
commands of the two Houses, in which the royal will was contained,
and threatened him, if he did not obey, with open force and a formal
blockade on the side of the river. John Byron was the first to give
utterance to those feelings of chivalrous loyalty, without any stain
of factious ambition, which still survived in a large part of the
nobility and gentry. He wrote to the King’s secretary that he would
take care that, in conformity with his Majesty’s commands, he gave no
valid cause for dispute: but he said that they were seeking occasion
against him<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. If they cut off his supplies, and attacked him with
open force, he certainly could not promise, in the condition he was in,
to hold out long: but they should purchase both the place and his life
as dearly as he could make them<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>. It was not however to come to
such extremities. The Commons preferred at once to request the removal
of Byron: the King begged to know their complaint against him: they
answered that in times of imminent danger the advice of Parliament was
a sufficient reason. Charles I did not in fact dare to resist: for
these were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> days before the departure of
the Queen, when he sought to avoid a formal breach. Byron was present
at the sitting at which the King’s answer in the affirmative was
announced. He said that only one charge could be made against him, of
having been appointed by the King and being faithful to him and only
begged to be allowed to resign the place into the King’s own hands.
With the King’s consent the Tower was now finally handed over to a
governor of the Parliamentary party, named Conyers.</p>

<p>Similar sentiments were expressed by Colonel Goring, commandant of
Portsmouth, who this time did not flinch. He was summoned by Parliament
to Westminster to give advice about arming the country: he delayed to
appear for some time, and when no other pretext was available, declared
plainly that he saw that Parliament was entering on an illegal course,
and refused his obedience. He made his garrison take an oath of this
tenour, and admitted within the walls of his sea-fortress none but
undoubted adherents of the King.</p>

<p>A direct and typical conflict between the views of Parliament and of
the King in relation to military authority took place at Hull.</p>

<p>Kingston-upon-Hull, which had grown from a fishing village to a
considerable town, through its favourable situation for the northern
trade, had been carefully fortified by Henry VIII, who devoted to this
purpose some of the spoils of the monasteries. Strafford had placed a
military magazine there to serve for the war against Scotland: since
the disbanding of his army, the block-houses, castle, and magazine had
remained under the charge of the magistrates and inhabitants of Hull.
The attention of Parliament had long ago been directed to this place:
the mayor had been requested to disarm all recusants in the city and
its neighbourhood, as danger was apprehended from them. Now however
that an open breach had taken place, the danger was grown most serious,
particularly as the court at once turned its eyes on Hull. Parliament
resolved to secure the place by a governor who could be fully trusted,
Sir John Hotham. Hotham had taken part in the German war in the
service of the Elector Palatine, and had been promised by the King the
reversion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> of Hull, but afterwards had attached
himself decidedly to the dominant party in Parliament, of which he
was a member. He was a rude soldier, violent and ambitious, and had
a very good idea of how to combine his opinions with his interests:
he immediately sent his son to take possession of the post to which
Parliament had appointed him. Meanwhile Lord Newcastle had also entered
the town, though under another name, in order to win it for the King,
and introduce a Royalist garrison. The mayor and aldermen of Hull were
in the utmost perplexity; for the moment they admitted neither force,
and prayed Parliament, through the representatives of the city, to come
to an understanding with the King about the introduction of a garrison:
but under the influence of the elder Hotham, Parliament spurned any
such evasion of the difficulty<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>. In the city itself the magistrates
were mostly for the King, but the greater part of the citizens inclined
to the Parliament. Under these circumstances Hotham gained his point,
and entered Hull with orders to admit none but Parliamentary troops.</p>

<p>The King had by this time (March 19) come to York: he had been
inclined to return to Scotland, but the country gentry, as well as
the inhabitants of the city, displayed so much devotion to him that
he determined to remain. Both the interests of the county and his own
required the occupation of Hull. There was no doubt that Hotham would
reject every other measure: but would he have the face to oppose the
King himself? Charles I, who in spite of so much contrary experience,
was always persuaded of the vast influence of royalty, deemed this
impossible, and resolved to go in person to Hull, and obtain entrance
into its fortifications.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April the Elector Palatine, and the King’s younger
son, James, arrived one day in Hull for the purpose, as they said,
of inspecting the fortifications of the place in company with the
governor. They were still busy with this, when the King sent word that
he also meant to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> and that accommodation must be
provided for him and his suite: he might have some three hundred men
with him. But Hotham knew that if he admitted only twenty, he should
no longer be master of the place, where there was still considerable
number of Royalists. His resolution was instantly taken: he raised the
drawbridge and informed the King who was already at the gates, in the
humblest language, but still in direct terms, that he could not admit
him without violating the confidence reposed in him by the Parliament.</p>

<p>The speech is extant in which Hotham justified his conduct to the
inhabitants of Hull<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. He declared that it was his duty to die for
King and Parliament, but when there was hostility between them, he must
obey the latter; that Parliament was entrusted by the King and nation
with power to order everything that concerned the common weal: if it
noticed dangers anywhere, it was bound by its duty to obviate them, and
no one could then refuse obedience to it, without breaking his troth to
the sovereign. He took credit to himself for what he had done, and said
that he did not think to renounce his loyalty to the King in proving
his obedience to Parliament for an example to others.</p>

<p>Thus was accomplished in a striking manner what had long been pending:
the authority of Parliament as representing the nation, in military
matters as well as all others, confronted the personal power of the
crown, and that with a claim to superiority. The King was refused
admission into one of his fortresses, in the name of the authority
represented by the two Houses of Parliament, in which his own title
was comprised. Charles I had to retire from Hull without achieving
his object. He declared John Hotham guilty of treason: but Parliament
replied by resolving that such a sentence on a member of the Lower
House, especially without any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> judicial
proceedings, was a new breach of the privileges of Parliament, and an
illegal act on the King’s part.</p>

<p>Thus was one legality opposed to the other, one obedience to the
other, one conception of the supreme power to the other: and the great
question now was, which of the two would gain the upper hand in England.</p>

<p>There were still numberless persons who would not listen to the
argument propounded by Hotham at Hull, but professed a doctrine totally
opposite. The Lower House, they said, is elected by subjects, and
represents only subjects: no sort of authority over princes can be
conferred on it by them. Parliament appealed to the fundamental laws of
the realm; but we must first know what is their true meaning: it seeks
to give effect to the protest passed and sworn to three years ago, but
in that the honour of his Majesty was reserved. The King has conceded
all that can fairly be asked, perhaps too much: Parliament is openly
usurping the whole executive power, and desiring to wield it at its
pleasure: but there cannot be two swords in the kingdom. Certainly in
obeying the King we have no idea of neglecting the duty we owe to the
kingdom.</p>

<p>These opinions prevailed at York<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>, whither the King returned from
Hull: and once they were manifested there unmistakeably. In an assembly
of the county gentry Charles I explained what had happened, adding
that he would rather lose his three crowns than leave such an insult
unpunished<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>, and asked them to form a guard for his protection.
What the King said of his own position was greeted with joyful assent,
but what he let fall about the intentions of Parliament roused
expressions of disapproval. In a second assembly, at Heworth Moor, near
York, the freeholders and tenants also took part. The King appeared at
the head of his newly-formed guard, both horse and foot: the nobles
and gentry constituted the first, the militia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>
the second. A proclamation was issued in which the King professed his
adherence to the Protestant religion and the laws of the land, and
claimed the support of the assembly in maintaining them. The Cavaliers
waved their hats: the people cried ‘God bless the King’: yet even here
there was not complete unanimity. There were still some Puritans and
adherents of the Lower House in York who were encouraged to express
their sentiments by the presence of some commissioners of Parliament.
At the meeting Thomas Fairfax placed a petition of this nature on the
pommel of the King’s saddle, who refused to receive it, as coming from
a single man: it seemed to him sufficiently rejected by the joyful
acclamations of his partisans. A devoted mob, of perhaps 20,000 men,
attended him back to the city as if in triumph. The Cavaliers had
the upper hand in York as decidedly as the Roundheads in London. The
ancient nobility, such as the Savilles, who were now again firmly
attached to the King, set the fashion which was followed by most of the
city and county. The York people would scarcely endure the Londoners
who were settled there in business: they regarded them as accomplices
of those who had transgressed against the King. Three knights brought
to the King as a present a charger splendidly caparisoned in the
ancient style: the velvet which covered it reached to the ground<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>.</p>

<p>Similar exhibitions of chivalrous and popular adherence were made in
Derby, Lancaster, and other northern counties.</p>

<p>The thirteen counties of Wales unanimously rejected the requests made
to them by Parliament, and assured the King of their entire devotion.
The sheriff and gentry of Nottingham entreated Parliament not to expect
them to make war on the King, to whom they were bound by the oath of
allegiance and supremacy. This address is also remarkable, because it
touches on all the questions which at that moment the men who had not
yet committed themselves to a party were most anxiously deliberating.
The theory of what might be considered lawful in England was discussed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> at length: the view taken is, that as the King
and Lords can make no law without the assent of the Commons of England,
so this threefold cord may not in any way be separated: the Commons
with the Lords are equally incompetent to make laws, so that what the
Parliament called laws were merely declarations of opinion, to which no
one was bound to pay obedience.</p>

<p>From this point of view others sought to define more closely the
relations of the three powers. The union of monarchical, aristocratic,
and democratic forms in the English constitution, contrived by the
wisdom of antiquity, was, they thought, endangered by the demands of
Parliament. The object of the monarchical form was that the country
under one head might be able to repel foreign attacks and quell
internal tumult, and for this it was indispensable that the head of
the state should possess the right of making peace and war, as well as
the nomination to the military and great civil offices: he must have
the power to enforce the laws. The House of Commons was not intended
to take part in the government, or to nominate those who were to
conduct it, though it possessed the initiative in the imposition of
taxes, and the right of impeaching those who might misuse the power
entrusted to them by the King. The function of the Upper House was to
hold the balance between these two powers. The absolute power which
ruled the country was composed of the union of the royal prerogative,
the judicial power of the Lords, and the legal privileges of the
Commons<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.</p>

<p>The assumption in this argument is that the laws, by which the limits
of each power within the constitution were defined, were old and
well-known: as in earlier times the King, so now the Lower House was
reproached with misunderstanding the laws and exceeding its powers.</p>

<p>This accusation could certainly not be controverted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1642.</span> the point of view of the existing constitution. The chief
efforts of the dominant party had been hitherto directed to forcing
the King to assent to the bills submitted to him: he had quitted the
capital in order to escape further pressure: their proceeding, in spite
of his refusal, to give effect to their own views, and this in matters
of the highest importance, was an open violation of the existing
constitution and of the recognised mutual rights of the parties. They
acted as though the King’s consent was no longer necessary: Henry
Martin once propounded the theory that as the opinion of all the
Commons of the realm was implied in the vote of the Lower House, so
the King’s consent was included in the vote of the Lords<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>; that
the Parliament of the realm was his great council, whose opinion he
must follow; and that the old Norman formula of refusal ought to be
abolished.</p>

<p>The zealous adherents of Parliament did not repel the charge of
transgressing the laws: they accepted it. Their doctrine was—starting
from Oliver St. John’s language on the Bill of Attainder—that
Parliament could not be bound by written laws, for that the legislative
power in the fullest extent belonged to it, which meant merely equity
applied by common consent to politics: that inferior tribunals were
bound by written laws, but not the highest, which would cease to be
such if bound<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>. This theory distinguished between fundamental laws
and principles, recognising only the latter as conclusive.</p>

<p>The view which some years later John Milton sought to uphold, namely,
that Parliament was not co-ordinate with the King, but superior, rested
on the same basis. For, he argued, the King governs through the laws;
the Parliament, even in the absence (as then) of any King’s assent,
makes and repeals them, so that Parliament is above all positive law.
Thus a power, if not literally absolute, yet exalted above the law,
such as the King claimed, was ascribed to Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>

<p>The Parliament still avoided expressing or sanctioning on its own
part these ideas, which had been generated in theorising minds by its
position and growing strength: it adhered above all to its practical
demands.</p>

<p>These were once more laid before the King in definite form in the
first half of June. They are the so-called nineteen propositions, a
sort of programme of the condition into which it was sought to bring
the nation. Three demands were therein specially put forward: one
religious, for the change of the existing state of things in relation
to church government and the liturgy, in conformity with a consultation
to be held with learned theologians, and with the resolutions of
Parliament: one political, that all nominations to high offices should
require the approval of the two Houses, and that even the Privy Council
should consist of only a fixed number of persons, all of whom must be
approved by both Houses: finally one military, that the proposals in
reference to the militia should be accepted, at least temporarily<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.
The King answered that were he to assent to these propositions, he
should not be able to fulfil the duty incumbent upon him: they were the
sort of conditions that are made with a prisoner.</p>

<p>While thus definitely refusing, he was already aware that he had by
no means the unanimous opinion of Parliament opposed to him. We have
already more than once mentioned the discussions within the House on
the most important questions; the first on Strafford’s attainder, the
second about the attack on Episcopacy, and the preparation of the
Remonstrance: but the majority had always persevered in the course once
adopted. Now came the third and greatest division. In spite of the
protests, to which several lords had resorted, the resolutions about
the militia were passed, and the nineteen propositions laid before
the King as the terms of Parliament. Seeing that thus the ancient
constitution of the country was threatened at once in spiritual and in
political matters, a number of Lords deemed it their duty, and had the
courage, to separate from Parliament. At the sitting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1642.</span> May 30 the Upper House was informed that twelve Lords at
once had been seen on the road to York, and then actually in that
city. They were Monmouth, Northampton, Salisbury, Devonshire, Dover,
Dunsmore, Andover, Capel, Rich, Grey, Lovelace, and Coventry. Soon
followed men like Lord Hertford, who had taken a great part in the
beginning of the movement. A certain vacillation was exhibited by some
before they took the step, by others after it; but the majority were
fully determined, and held to their purpose. The number was soon so
great that it seemed less wonderful that they should be gone, than
that the rest should stay behind at Westminster<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>. It was regarded
as an event of great importance when Lord Littleton carried off to the
King the Great Seal, in conformity with a promise made at the time
of receiving it, a feat not accomplished without some stratagem and
danger. A number of the Commons also repaired to the King, around whom
was formed a company that professed to represent the State, and treated
the acts of the Parliament at Westminster as lawless usurpations.</p>

<p>The Lords however did not join the King unconditionally. A mutual
engagement was entered into, on the basis of maintaining the English
constitution. The King promised the Lords to require from them no
other obedience than was grounded on the laws, and to take under his
protection every one who refused to obey the declarations and orders of
the two Houses at Westminster. The Lords undertook to defend the King,
his crown, dignity, and rightful privileges against every man, and
to obey no orders not warranted by the laws: especially they pledged
themselves to this in respect of military ordinances lacking the King’s
assent. Both parties bound themselves to support the true Protestant
religion, as by law established,—thus excluding Presbyterianism,—the
lawful liberties of the subjects, and the privileges both of the King
and of Parliament. The King says ‘the just privileges of the three
estates of Parliament<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>,’ which included the restoration of the
bishops to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> their parliamentary rights: the
Lords say ‘the just privileges of your Majesty and your two Houses of
Parliament.’ Twenty-five Lords signed the agreement on June 13, 1642.</p>

<p>These promises were given and these declarations exchanged by way of
opposition to the demands contained in the nineteen propositions<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.
For a moment they flattered themselves that the weight added to the
King’s cause would incline the Parliament to more peaceful views: but
the contrary happened, the feeling of hostility grew with the number of
enemies.</p>

<p>The Parliament complained of the evil-minded persons about the King,
called Cavaliers, who had no respect for the laws, and no fear of God
or man: that in York nothing less was intended than the dissolution
and overthrow of the government of the kingdom. In language of earnest
apprehension it warned one and all to aid in averting this pressing
danger according to the promise contained in the protest. The Lords
at Westminster also, under the influence of a document that reached
them, declared it necessary to provide for the safety of the King and
the kingdom<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. Thereupon, in complete contravention of the royal
decrees, the militia in the city and neighbouring counties were put
under arms, voluntary contributions were collected, and a loan made.</p>

<p>The associated Lords at York declared in reply that it appeared from
the parliamentary papers which had reached them, that the sacred person
of the King, religion, the liberty of the subject, Parliament and its
rights, were all in danger<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>: in order to assist the King in their
defence, they proclaimed a levy of cavalry, which all of them promised
to raise, and to maintain in the field for a fixed time.</p>

<p>On June 17 the assembly at Westminster, on June 22 that at York,
declared the country in danger, each through the other; and they
proceeded to arm against each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>

<p>We see now how it came to such an extremity. It is obvious that this
idea was eventually entertained through the Queen’s influence, before
her departure: but all still depended on whether an accommodation was
possible in respect of the military power. The King was willing for the
time to admit the participation of Parliament: but the latter claimed
not only the recommendation of commanders for that occasion, but also
that their removal should be made to depend exclusively on the vote
of the House, and required the unconditional obedience of the country
to its ordinances. This would have deprived the King for ever of the
sword, and made the Parliament master in his stead<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>: the King would
not go so far, nor would the majority of the nobility or of the gentry
allow it. For they thought that the sword did not belong to Parliament,
and that absolute executive authority was not its function: moreover
resistance was contrary to the old doctrines of the established Church.
The contest was not between absolute power and a democratic republic,
though these ideas at times appeared in the background. The one party
in fact desired Parliament not without the King, the other the King
not without Parliament: but the one sought to maintain the autonomy of
the throne and of the Church, and the estates of the realm as hitherto
constituted, the other would shake the foundation of the Church, and
subject the crown unconditionally to Parliament. On this question a
dispute broke out within the legislative body itself: part broke loose
from the rest, and joined the King.</p>

<p>As now both sides had formally decided to make preparations for
war, the whole country immediately became involved in the hostility
between them. In all the counties the Parliamentary ordinance and the
full powers conferred by the King on his adherents (commission of
array<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>) encountered one another, both couched in the same terms,
both directed to the same end, yet diametrically opposed to each other
in intention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>

<p>In the eastern counties the influence of the capital gained obedience
for the ordinance; in the northern, through the influence of York,
the commission gained the upper hand; but neither unopposed. In the
midland counties the chiefs who had declared for the opposite sides
contended together: in Lincoln, Willoughby of Parham and Lord Lindsay;
in Leicester, the Earl of Stamford, who had been deputed by the
Parliament, and the sheriff appointed by the King, Henry Hastings,
son of the Earl of Huntingdon; in Northampton, the Brookes and the
Comptons; in Berkshire, the Earl of Holland and Lord Lovelace; and
others elsewhere. In Oxfordshire the Earl of Berkshire encountered
Hampden, and was arrested by him. As in Derby the Royalists, so
in Wiltshire the adherents of the Parliament under Lord Pembroke,
preponderated. In Lancashire and Cheshire Lord Stanley mustered in
three separate places bodies of 20,000 men, all armed with muskets
and pikes, and ready for the King’s service: but this powerful levy,
besides awakening jealousy at court, aroused the opposition of the
lesser magnates, led by some members of Parliament<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. William Earl
of Hertford, to whom the King had entrusted seven Welsh counties, and
ten others bordering on them, made a great figure; but he was not
undisputed master of them: in Gloucestershire Parliamentary opinions
prevailed, and in Pembroke they were gaining ground.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Parliamentary majority however derived their main
strength from their alliance with the capital. Here the Common Council,
with the aid of Parliament, had completely thrown off the authority of
the chief magistrate. He lost the right which he had hitherto enjoyed,
of summoning and dismissing the council, as well as the initiative in
its deliberations. His votes were swamped by the great number of the
rest; the King’s adherents were ejected: one of the Puritan leaders
succeeded to the Royalist lord mayor. A committee was appointed to
find means of defence, which controlled the city militia, and in which
the Puritans had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> majority. In the city
there were now no preachers except of this persuasion; all others had
been removed or silenced. From the pulpits not merely religious but
also political opinions were taught: those were counted as the most
faithful who were most eager for war with the King, and contributed
towards it<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. Under these circumstances the proposal of the Lords
to form a sufficient fund for the maintenance of the army, obtained
full approval<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>: and their reasoning was also calculated to make an
impression. They observed that the whole kingdom might serve as their
security: if Parliament prevailed, every man’s loan would certainly be
returned with interest: otherwise not that only, but everything else
they possessed would be endangered. The citizens vied with one another
in bringing in their gold and silver. The preparations of the city were
far in advance of those in the country.</p>

<p>Following the example of the Common Council, Parliament now appointed
a committee of safety, as it was called, for the defence of Parliament
and of the realm, and to repel all armed opposition. We find among
its members Pym, Hampden, Martin, and Fiennes, as well as some more
moderate men, such as Hollis and Stapleton: of the Lords there were
Essex, Northumberland, Holland, and Say. From this committee proceeded
the proposal, which was adopted by a resolution of July 12, that an
army of 10,000 men should be raised, and the Earl of Essex placed at
the head of it.</p>

<p>Essex and Holland had refused compliance with the King’s orders to
follow him and discharge the duties of their offices, and committed
themselves fully to the Parliament, which in return took them up very
warmly. When now Essex made up his mind to take command of the armed
force that was being raised against the King, every one saw that he
was thus offending beyond forgiveness, and staking his whole future
on the issue: the Parliament in return pledged itself to live and die
with him. His support was of indescribable importance to the progress
of the cause. He was esteemed steadfast in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span>
opposition, and enjoyed the full confidence of the Presbyterians<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>.
The memory of his father made him popular in the country: he himself
had been at first courted, afterwards neglected by the government of
the Stuarts, and seemed to have some claim against them. The ease with
which the Parliamentary army was levied was ascribed to his name and
zeal: he chose as his subordinates men conspicuous in the dominant
party. Balfour served as lieutenant-general; among the colonels of
foot we find Brooke, Mandeville, Hollis, Hampden: among the captains
of horse Cromwell, Fiennes, and Haslerig. On the same principle on
which the general chose the colonels and captains, they made up their
regiments and companies, and clothed them in their colours<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>. The
army thoroughly represented the ruling party, which held general
control of the war, as yet without marked separation between the
Presbyterians and the Independents.</p>

<p>Parliament took charge of the revenues, collected the customs,
contracted loans, controlled the exchequer: it had already succeeded in
getting into its hands the national fleet.</p>

<p>Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland, had at an earlier time been
raised by the special favour of the King to the dignity of high
admiral: he had however long detached himself from the policy of the
court, both on principle and from dislike to the persons highest in
influence there: in the military question he took the side of the
Parliament. His vice-admiral, Pennington, had drawn on himself the
ill-will of Parliament by aiding the flight of some of the accused
ministers: it desired to displace him, and designated the Earl of
Warwick as his successor. Northumberland, against the well-known
feeling of the King, lent his aid to this. The King fell into a violent
passion and pronounced the dismissal of Northumberland, who without
a word laid down his office, saying that it would ill become him to
seek to hold, against the King’s will, a post which he owed to his
extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> confidence. The effect of this
obedience was however very disastrous for the King: the Parliament at
once made Warwick admiral, with all the powers that Northumberland
had enjoyed. The King might say what he pleased: with very slight
difficulty the fleet passed under the supreme command of Warwick. It
had cost the King immense pains to raise this fleet: he had quarrelled
with his people about the means of maintaining it: and now without
resistance it became subservient to the Presbyterian and Parliamentary
interests.</p>

<p>We must not omit to notice that the leading men in this matter were
connected by close ties of relationship. The great favourite of Queen
Elizabeth was the father of the Earl of Essex: he had two sisters, of
whom one was the mother of Northumberland, the other of Warwick. Among
these the Earl of Warwick had undoubtedly the most resolution and the
most active spirit: he was the man who had sustained Presbyterianism in
England in the times of greatest oppression, and had chiefly promoted
the religious emigration to America. In him the temper which broke down
the ecclesiastical and royalist system of the Stuarts found its most
lively expression: without being altogether correct in his morals, he
stood at the head of the strict Presbyterians: he was enterprising,
determined, irresistible. As Mandeville had been led by him to join
the party, we may assume that he exercised decisive influence over his
nearer kinsmen, who besides were so inclined already.</p>

<p>Their position is not without analogy to the political circumstances
of the first Essex. He too desired to overthrow by popular assistance
an administration of Spanish and anti-Protestant tendencies. Now it
had come to pass that his son and nephew were at the head of the land
and sea forces of England, in direct opposition to the King and his
advisers.</p>

<p>If we consider the extent and the concentration of the Parliamentary
strength, we shall almost wonder that the Royalists, ill organised, and
deprived of the ordinary resources of the supreme power, should have
ventured to take the field against it.</p>

<span class="small">THE CAMPAIGNS OF 1642 AND 1643.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Queen Henrietta Maria had a long and stormy passage from Dover to
Helvoetsluys, in which one of her ships was lost: she never exhibited
however any fear for herself when shipwreck and death seemed to
be impending, but spoke only of God, and of the danger of her
husband<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>. At the Hague she delivered over her daughter, not without
ceremony, to the charge of Prince Frederick Henry of Orange, who
received her with all the respect due to members of royal houses.</p>

<p>Her first object was, through the Prince’s influence to induce the
States-General to mediate in favour of her husband; but when his
affairs at York took an unexpectedly favourable turn<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>, she devoted
all her attention to procuring him support. The fugitives who had
escaped to the Netherlands, Percy, Jermyn, Windebank, Lord Finch, were
in this very useful to her. Many of her jewels were sold: the Queen did
not deny that they appeared to her more beautiful than ever, when taken
out of their gold settings: she had to part with them for about half
their value. Most of them served as security for the loan which she
raised: luckily she had brought a full power from her husband for this
purpose: at times even this did not suffice, and the Prince of Orange
guaranteed payment. She actually succeeded in sending over some money,
more than £8000, as she herself reckoned in July, which gave very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> desired help; for it was not all the nobility
and gentry who provided for themselves, and moreover the officers of
the old army, who appeared at York as before in London, and were the
very core of the Cavalier party, were urgently in want of pay. Soon
afterwards followed military stores, bought in the Netherlands, saddles
and harness for the cavalry, carbines, pistols, muskets, matchlocks,
even cannon and the necessary ammunition. There is no doubt that from
this source a military undertaking was first made possible to the King.</p>

<p>There has been much controversy as to which party actually began the
war, the King or Parliament. Unquestionably Parliament took the lead in
preparations—the militia preceded the array: the King however was the
first to determine to draw the sword.</p>

<p>As Newcastle and the mouth of the Tyne were in the King’s hands, it
would have been an inestimable advantage to his position in the North,
if he could have occupied Hull also. Towards this he directed his first
movement about the end of July. The troops sought to secure both banks
of the Humber, and threw up entrenchments: guns were brought up from
the ships, with a view to a siege. Hotham was once more urged not to
compel the King to seize by force on what was his by right<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>; but
he, still holding to his original purpose, replied that he was bound to
obey Parliament, the supreme court of the kingdom<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>. Parliament had
already a force in readiness, which came to the aid of the besieged,
under one Meldrum, a Scot, so that they were able to meet the attacks
of the Royalists by successful sorties. Here the first blood of the war
was shed: the King found himself compelled to abandon the undertaking,
especially as Warwick was bringing relief to the town by sea.</p>

<p>The leaders at York had hoped to surprise some inland town also,
especially Coventry, which owed special attachment to the house
of Stuart, because the charter constituting it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1642.</span> city, had been granted by James I. One of the chief men at the
court, Spenser Compton, Earl of Northampton, who had once filled a
municipal office there, declared that he could guarantee its fidelity.
Accordingly the King sent word to the magistrates, in the familar
style of old times, which he loved to assume, that he intended to
come on an early day, August 19, and sup with them. Compton repaired
to the city, in order to prepare for him a good reception. Meanwhile
however Puritan opinions, sustained by zealous preachers like King and
the learned Abbot, had gained the upper hand in Coventry. The ideas
of Parliamentary independence found as much favour there as in Hull,
Gloucester, and most other cities. Compton was received with hostile
demonstrations; and the city refused admittance, not directly to the
King, but to the armed men whom he brought with him: and when on the
next day these prepared to open the gates by force, the inhabitants did
not hesitate to repel force by force. Parliamentary troops very soon
came up, and made any further attempt impossible.</p>

<p>While the King was thus failing in all his enterprises, those of
the Parliament succeeded. Colonel Goring, who had raised the King’s
standard at Portsmouth, was immediately cut off from all communications
both by land and by sea; and as he was also ill supplied with
provisions, for Warwick had seized a corn-ship destined for him, he was
without much trouble forced to surrender the place.</p>

<p>Thus the beginnings of the campaign presaged but little future good for
the King.</p>

<p>Charles I had warned his partisans north of the Trent to assemble round
the royal standard, which he should set up at Nottingham on August 22:
for it was thought desirable to fix the seat of war in the county from
which that declaration of entire devotion had proceeded. This was the
signal, in England as well as in France, which in old times summoned
the feudal vassals to personal service: it was raised chiefly when
great dangers threatened the country, sometimes against the Welsh,
sometimes against the Scots. And as in the civil wars of France a short
time before, by far the larger part of the nobility had gathered to
the banner of the legitimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> King, so Charles
I expected to assemble round his standard all those who thought the
dignity of the crown endangered by the hostility of Parliament. As
inscription it bore the words ‘Render to Caesar the things that are
Caesar’s,’ and this exactly symbolised the military authority of the
King, the validity of which was now called in question. The King
hastened back from Coventry in order to be present on the day: on the
afternoon of August 22 the standard was brought with great ceremony
out of the castle of Nottingham into the open field. When the King and
the lords and gentry of his suite had taken their places—there were
several squadrons of horse and two or three hundred men on foot—a
proclamation was read, in which all faithful subjects were required to
lend aid to the King against the rebellion of the Earl of Essex. The
King had at the very last moment made alterations in the language of
the proclamation, so that the herald had difficulty in reading it. The
standard was brought back into the castle in the evening: next day the
ceremony was repeated in the presence of the King<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>, and twice more
without him. No great and immediate result could be expected on the
spot.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary army gathered in threatening proximity. The
Earl of Essex appeared in the field on September 9, and advanced
to Northampton, with an army of twenty regiments of infantry and
seventy-five squadrons of cavalry, which were not all of the full
complement, but still numbered from 12,000 to 14,000 men. The formation
of this army and its advance secured the Parliamentary interest in
all the neighbouring counties. The King, who had only 500 horse and a
couple of weak regiments of foot with him, could not possibly await its
approach: he gave up entirely his first plan of holding Nottingham,
as well as of conquering Coventry and Hull. Some time before he had
been urged to take up his quarters in the north-western provinces.
Warrington in Lancashire had once been suggested as a place where his
adherents might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> easily assemble from all sides:
the Stanleys<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> thought it was mere jealousy of their superior power,
which had prevented this being agreed to. Now however a similar project
was adopted. Royalist opinions were especially prevalent in Worcester,
Hereford and Shropshire. The King, retiring before Essex, went direct
to Shrewsbury, whither the old Lord Mayor after some hesitation invited
him.</p>

<p>Here once more his cause found unexpected sympathy. It was shown that
the feelings of personal devotion and loyalty, which had bound the
vassals to their princes in earlier centuries, was not yet extinct in
England. The elevation of the royal standard cannot be regarded as
barren of results when, even among those who had hitherto sided with
the Parliament, men were found who could not bear to stay at home
when the royal standard was displayed in the field<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. Some joined
the King because they had always heard from their ancestors that they
must ever hold to the crown: others thought it unfair to abandon in
his distress the prince whose bread they had eaten. Some too appeared
in the field who did not unconditionally share the King’s sentiments;
but the attitude of Parliament was still more offensive to them, and
as it would have been counted as cowardice not to take part in the war
when all the world was rushing to arms, they joined the King. To the
majority his cause appeared by far the better, now that he had conceded
so much and all to no purpose. Many a young lawyer threw away his long
robe in order to fight for the good cause. Some regarded it as holy,
and thought that whoever lost his life in defending it might be deemed
a martyr.</p>

<p>Through the influence of these sentiments an army assembled in
Shropshire around the King, which according to the notion of that
age was worthy of the name—2000 cavalry, 1500 dragoons, and 6000
foot soldiers: and new reinforcements were expected daily. A great
assistance was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> promised by the munitions of
war collected at Chester, which had originally been destined for
Ireland, but now fell into the King’s hands. More money came in than
was expected, and the soldiery were well paid. Some commanders of
great military merit joined the King, such as Jacob Astley, reputed
one of the best major-generals in Europe; and Ruthven of Ettrick, who
had learned the art of war in Germany, and had won new renown by his
defence of Edinburgh against the Scots,—a man of fire and devotion,
and a thorough soldier. Prince Rupert of the Palatinate, true to his
word, had already made his appearance at Nottingham by his uncle’s
side, as soon as the war broke out, for which he had offered his aid:
he had come over with the Queen’s assistance, together with his brother
Edward. He brought with him several specimens of military apparatus, in
order to introduce into England, where they were as yet unknown, the
improvements in war material which had been made in Germany. Especially
he trained the cavalry in the tactics then adopted in Germany. He
made many a daring raid through the country in order to encourage the
royalists, harry the rebels, seize their stores and divert them to the
King’s service. His troopers learned the art of war by practising it.</p>

<p>The first successful feat of arms fell to Rupert’s lot. He had occupied
Worcester, but abandoned it again as untenable. His horsemen and
officers were bivouacking near the place, and many had dismounted and
were taking their ease on the grass, when the van of the hostile army
was seen approaching. In a moment they had resumed their arms and
mounted their horses; and with a sudden impetuous onset the squadrons
of Rupert, who was himself surrounded by the boldest officers, charged
the Parliamentary horse and instantly broke them<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>—a success of
no trifling importance, as it gave the King’s troops confidence in
themselves and in their leaders.</p>

<p>The King, who thus enjoyed the scarcely expected pleasure of seeing his
enemies prisoners before him, now felt that he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1642.</span> venture to advance towards the capital. It is scarcely credible
that they should have confidently expected to be in London within a
short time. We even catch the voices of some who believed it without
wishing it: they were again afraid of the unrestrained domination of
the men who had now most influence with the King. The latter expected
to be obliged to fight on the way, but did not doubt that he should win
the victory, and find it all the easier to conquer London, where his
partisans would rise in his favour.</p>

<p>Essex in fact could not let the King advance on London, where continued
preparations were going on, but where things were not yet in a
condition to withstand an attack: the King too could not venture, while
Essex followed him, to advance so far as to place himself between two
hostile armies. When he reached Edgcot on the borders of Warwickshire,
he adopted the advice of the Prince, who now commanded the rear, on
which most depended, that he should take up a strong position opposite
the Parliamentary army, and attack it before it grew too strong.</p>

<p>On Sunday October 23, the King for the first time saw from the height
of Edgehill his enemies drawn up before him in full order of battle. It
was not till the afternoon that the two armies came within range. How
the people assembled for worship in the neighbouring parishes must have
trembled when they heard the thunder of cannon from those heights!</p>

<p>In English warfare the different arms were not yet so well combined in
action as in Germany. First the cavalry measured their strength. The
Parliamentarians fired their carbines and pistols at a badly judged
distance, and at this moment were charged by the Royalists, who put
them to flight at the first shock. It was not a fight, says one report,
but a massacre, and then a headlong pursuit in which the victors could
not be controlled by their officers: among other booty,—for they were
above all things eager for booty and intent on it,—the carriage of the
Earl of Essex fell into their hands.</p>

<p>But while the Royal cavalry were thus engaged, the Parliamentary
infantry had gained the upper hand. The regiments raised in London
under Essex and Hollis fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> splendidly: they
consisted mainly of young men who had taken part in the tumults in the
city, and had since been drilled by German corporals and had learned to
shoot<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>. These troops, with the horsemen, of whom several troops had
stood their ground, now endangered the King himself: the forces around
him gave way or suffered very severe loss. Lord Lindsay, who held the
rank of Commander-in-chief, but through the influence of Prince Rupert
had been deprived of his proper command, led his regiment forward, pike
in hand, and was mortally wounded. In the struggle the great standard
fell once into the enemy’s hand, but was rescued again: the bullets
rained in the immediate neighbourhood of the King. Charles I did not
give way to fear: in the midst of the firing he was heard to call out
the watchword of the day, ‘For God and the King’: his position however
was one of great danger, when at last the cavalry returned from the
pursuit, and restored the balance of arms<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.</p>

<p>Next day both armies remained a mile apart without engaging. The
victory remained undecided, but this gave the Royalists, who were the
weaker, great confidence. Prince Rupert is said to have proposed to
press on with his cavalry to Westminster and disperse the Parliament.
The rejection of the scheme is ascribed to Lord Bristol. Essex
retreated to Northampton and thence to London. The King occupied
Banbury, and then moved to Oxford, where he was received with triumph.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards we find him again in the field, to make the attempt on
London once before decided on. On November 4 he was at Reading, on the
10th at Colebrook: he contented himself with disarming the inhabitants
who were hostile to him, without doing them any other injury, so far as
it depended on him: for he held that he was their lawful King and they
his subjects. On the other side also this feeling had again spread:
even among the troops doubts had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1642.</span> raised
whether they could rightfully fight against the King. This opinion
was however neither widely enough spread to take much effect, nor
strong enough to make way against other contrary influences. We are
informed that the attack made by Rupert on Brentford, at a time when it
was thought that a cessation of hostilities might be looked for, did
serious injury to his cause. The London regiments lay there, and were
fearfully handled by the Welsh in the royal army, who had their failure
at Edgehill to atone for<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>, and this rekindled the popular hatred
against the Cavaliers. Fabulous tales were told of the cruelty of
Prince Rupert and his followers, which filled men’s minds with horror.
Parliament declared the attack to be one of those acts of treachery
which were to be expected of the King. Thus it was decided to offer the
most strenuous resistance to him. The Parliamentary army, reinforced
by the militia, assembled on Turnham Green in battle array: Essex went
from regiment to regiment, and was greeted with military familiarity as
‘Old Robin’: the short addresses of Skippon to his men made an equally
good impression. Their superiority was so decided that the King, with
the handful of troops left to him, might think himself lucky to get
back to Oxford without disaster.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary government by its demands for aid had at this time
certainly aroused considerable opposition in the capital. We are
assured that at one time seventy merchants were in prison for refusing
to contribute their means for arms to be used against the King. In
great assemblies of the citizens Royalist principles were eloquently
expressed, and received with approbation. This could not however have
any practical effect, so long as in the Common Council the opinions
before adopted maintained the preponderance. There John Pym well knew
how to stop all opposition by his usual persuasive eloquence; and the
assembly swore afresh to live and die with Parliament.</p>

<p>The Parliament however could not prevent every sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1643.</span> negotiation: in February 1643 it again made proposals to the
King. These not only repeat the contents of the nineteen propositions
in respect to the militia; but also in relation to religion, in
conformity with a resolution passed in the interval, demand in express
terms that the King should sanction the abolition of the old church
organisation from archbishops down to sacristans, and assent to the
bill for a new church government to be agreed on between the two Houses
and an assembly of divines. When these proposals were laid before
the King at Oxford in the garden of Christ Church, he remarked that
those who made them were not in earnest in seeking peace. There is
a tradition widely spread and often repeated, that in the personal
negotiations which ensued the King professed himself ready to give
way on one material point, but that next day, under the influence of
his immediate attendants, he made a contrary declaration<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>. We can
scarcely believe however that this decided the question. Between the
views of Parliament and the King’s claims there was a contradiction
so thorough, that no effectual approximation from which an end to the
quarrel might be expected could be imagined. More was now asked of
the King than before the war: through it he had attained a far better
position, and had no reason for yielding: he might hope in a new
campaign to win a still more favourable position.</p>

<p>The Queen was already come back to England to take part in the war.
The results of the events in England had necessarily been felt in
the Netherlands also. A commissioner from the Parliament went over,
and complained bitterly of the support which Charles I found in the
Netherlands: and his representations were by no means slighted by
the Estates of Holland, the strongest of the United Provinces. That
Province declared that it desired no breach with the Parliament, but
the maintenance of neutrality, a necessary condition of which was the
supplying neither of the contending parties with munitions of war.
The States-General also listened to the complaints. The commissioner
recalled the great interests of religion and liberty common to the
two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> countries, and the support which the
republic had formerly received from England. The Queen’s friends
replied that the republic of the Netherlands owed its independence not
to the English Parliament but rather to the English Crown, to Queen
Elizabeth and King James I, the predecessors of her husband, adding the
remark that it might some day be dangerous for them if a Parliament
alone ruled in England<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. No one in the States-General ventured
to dispute the principles on which the English Parliament and the
republic of Holland alike rested, but it was not deemed advisable to be
very earnest in their cause. Vessels laden with arms, which had been
detained, were again set free: English soldiers who wished to go to
the King were allowed to depart, not indeed in companies, but singly.
As at the first moment, so now again, the Queen found it in her power
to strengthen the forces of her husband. She had not been deceived in
the Prince of Orange, who assisted her at least underhand, for he saw
his own advantage in the maintenance of the Stuart dynasty. How her
heart swelled when events had taken such a turn that she might hope,
as she said, in spite of traitors to return to England and rejoin her
husband. That she had contributed somewhat to this result satisfied
her self-love: it was her pride and good fortune, especially as her
husband recognised it. She reminded him incessantly in her letters of
his promise to conclude no treaty without having taken her advice upon
it. If he gave up the control of the militia to Parliament only for a
single year, as she heard that he was inclined to do, he would render
both himself and her miserable, there would be nothing left to her
but to retire into a convent. If only she instead of her son had been
with Hotham on the walls of Hull, she would have seized the traitor
and thrown him over the walls, or he should have done the like to
her. The tidings of a treaty containing concessions, which was under
negotiation, so excited her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> that she burned
the letter in which the news was conveyed: she should like, she said,
a reconciliation, but only an honourable one. Towards the end of the
year she had again collected a supply of military stores, which she now
resolved to convey in person to the King. After many hindrances, and
being more than once driven back by wind and weather, she landed at
last on February 22 at Burlington, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. But
what a welcome did she receive in England! A couple of English ships
arrived immediately after her, and their crews did not hesitate to fire
on the house in which their Queen had taken up her abode. The balls
broke the windows of her bedchamber, and flew about her bed. Amidst
the whistling of the shot she quitted the house and the village, and
fled to shelter in the open field with the ladies of her suite: the men
stayed behind to take charge of the vessel in which were the military
stores; had it been necessary she would have placed herself at their
head. It did not however come to this, as the ebbing tide compelled the
ships to quit the bay. Attended by a long train of cannon, mortars,
and powder waggons, the chivalrous Queen entered York, where she was
received in triumph.</p>

<p>That she had escaped so many dangers by land and sea gave her infinite
confidence in herself and her cause: had it not been tempting God, she
would have gone up to a cannon’s mouth. In the very first letter after
her landing she urged her husband to come to no resolution until he had
heard further news from her. Writing from York in March, she declared
that if he made peace and disbanded his army, without having made an
end of the everlasting Parliament, she should be obliged again to quit
England, for she would never fall into the hands of those men. Some
had expected that she would come with the olive branch and attempt to
mediate between the King and Parliament: on the contrary, she exerted
all her influence to urge the King to unyielding adherence to his
prerogative. Her arrival made a more active plan of operations possible.</p>

<p>The original idea of Charles I had been to open the campaign by a new
advance on London. On the other hand the Earl of Essex, at the head
of the Parliamentary army,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> formed the plan of
attacking the King at Oxford. The first contest must therefore be for
Reading, which was as important for one scheme as for the other. Here
Essex obtained the advantage; on the twelfth day of the siege he took
Reading<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and fixed his head-quarters there: but when he advanced
nearer to Oxford, Prince Rupert proved to be stronger.</p>

<p>In one of the skirmishes of that period, on Chalgrove field, John
Hampden was seen to ride to the rear wounded, for the first time in any
such encounter, for he was as resolute in the field as in parliamentary
and political warfare: a few days later he died, with a presentiment,
as it appears, of the dangers impending over the country. The royal
troops obtained a decisive advantage over William Waller, who had
penetrated into the West, and thence moved towards Oxford: he was
surprised by the unexpected approach of the royal cavalry, and when
he turned to face them at Roundway Down, was completely defeated. The
horsemen of Waller and Haslerig, who looked like moving fortresses,
gave way before the lighter horse of the Royalists. In the midland
counties also the King’s party had attained a certain strength: the
family of Hastings had gained the upper hand in Leicestershire,
the Cavendishes in Lincolnshire. The inroads of Prince Rupert kept
Essex employed. Under these circumstances there was no longer any
difficulty in the Queen’s rejoining her husband. She met him on the
field of Edgehill (13 July, 1643), bringing three thousand infantry,
thirty squadrons of cavalry, some artillery, and ammunition in plenty
in a long train of waggons. She was received in Oxford with endless
rejoicings, the more so as the news of Waller’s defeat arrived at the
same time. With the Queen all good luck and success seemed to return.</p>

<p>In the same month (July 26) Bristol was taken. At an earlier period
Royalist tendencies had shown themselves among the magistrates, but
had been repressed: now, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> the outworks
were taken, the garrison despaired of maintaining its ground, and
surrendered the place. It was the second city in the country for
wealth and population, and full of arms which had been intended for
the Irish war. Most of the ships, lying in King’s Road, declared for
the King; and this gave scope for the idea of forming a fleet for
him, which should command the coasts of Wales and England, and open a
communication with Ireland. The hope now was to take Gloucester, and
thus become master of the Severn, and so of the inland traffic.</p>

<p>This change of fortune produced various favourable consequences.
Hotham, who had been almost the first to rebel openly, now proposed
to surrender to the King the fortress, which he had twice defended
against other Royalist attacks: he said that he had hardly slept a
night without his sword by his side. Lord Digby, who had fallen into
his power on his return from Holland, seems to have converted him;
and differences which he had with Fairfax and Cromwell strengthened
his resolve. In the town however Parliamentarian opinions had through
his own influence obtained undisputed predominance; and on the first
suspicion an attempt was made to secure his person. He was seized while
trying to escape, and his son, already a renowned captain, who had a
share in all his affairs, was taken in the town.</p>

<p>More fortunate was Hugh Cholmely, a distinguished member of Parliament,
at that time Governor of Scarborough. He took over to the Royalists
a body of three hundred men. The fortress remained for the time in
the hands of a Parliamentary captain, but he also soon went over, and
surrendered the place to the King<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>.</p>

<p>In London itself traces were discovered, or at least there was a talk,
of a plot to bring royal troops into the city and cause a rising of
the King’s adherents: a commission of array had been introduced with
great secrecy into the city, and inquiries had been made privately in
the different parishes, to find out who and how many could be reckoned
on. The intention then was, it seems, to bring about a coalition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> the Royalists and the friends of peace<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.
Edmund Waller, a member of the Lower House, who gave the name to
this conspiracy, and in fact had a great share in it, escaped, on
making a full confession, with fine and imprisonment. Tomkyns his
brother-in-law, and Challoner, who seem to have been more deeply
implicated, forfeited their lives. Their guilt however was not so clear
but that the people regarded their execution as a violent act of party
justice<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.</p>

<p>The Parliament, finding that there were so many in the city who were
calculated on for a conspiracy in favour of the King, adopted new
precautions. We must, said Pym, unite the good more closely, and have
a means of separating them from the bad. He proposed an oath, in which
the cause of religion was again identified with that of Parliament, and
the King’s army was directly stigmatised as Popish. Every man was to
declare that he was convinced in his conscience that the forces raised
by Parliament were engaged in the defence of a just cause, of the true
Protestant religion, and of the liberty of the subject, and to promise
that he would support and defend all others who had sworn the oath, in
everything they might do with this object<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. The two Houses agreed
that this oath should be administered in the army and among the people.
While the King was rising in strength and his party growing powerful,
it seemed necessary to consolidate afresh the Parliamentary faction.</p>

<p>But what a prospect was this for the nation: how long was it to fight
and ruin itself?</p>

<p>A very singular idea occurred to the Earl of Essex, General of the
Parliamentary army, who felt a sympathy with the people greater than
corresponded to his party position. The King, he thought, might go away
for a while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> then the two armies might advance
to meet one another at a place to be agreed on beforehand; and they
might once more try to conclude peace, and if that proved impossible,
decide the controversy with the sword. For the quarrel was altogether
within the nation, the two sides having different ideas of the English
constitution: and a battle would be like the judgment of God between
them<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.</p>

<p>In August 1643 it is plain that even in Parliament the two parties were
very nearly equal in strength. The Lords accepted a scheme by which
the armies were to be disbanded, the two great questions of religion
and the militia settled in parliamentary fashion, and the members who
had been excluded from either House for their Royalist sentiments or
for desertion were to be restored. This last point warranted a hope
that the great disputed questions themselves might still be settled in
a way not altogether hostile to the crown. Even the King’s suite saw
in it a step towards a return to grounds of recognised legality. The
Lords invited the concurrence of the Commons: on August 5, a Saturday,
the question was debated whether these proposals should be taken into
consideration; and even here the desire for peace was so keen, that
it was decided in the affirmative by a considerable majority; and by
a very narrow majority in a thinner house it was further agreed that
it should be done immediately. One article of the scheme was at once
agreed to, and then further deliberation was adjourned till the Monday.
Had the counsels of Parliament been guided entirely by the free votes
of its members, it is probable that those who were called the violent
party would have suffered a defeat<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>.</p>

<p>But their confederates were still entirely masters of the city.
The idea had before been suggested of collecting a second army in
opposition to Essex, and placing William Waller at its head, to carry
on the war more energetically than hitherto. The Lords’ proposals
redoubled the agitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> in men’s minds. A
petition was signed to the effect that they were destructive to
religion, law, and freedom, and only calculated to cool the ardour of
those who would otherwise have been ready to aid with their persons and
their substance. On Sunday the old zeal was rekindled by fiery sermons.
On Monday, as often in decisive moments, crowded masses of people
appeared before Parliament to declare their wish for war. The unpopular
names were greeted with threatening outcry. Amid this tumult the
resolution passed on Saturday was again discussed. The question whether
to take into consideration the proposals of the Lords was put afresh;
the first division gave a majority of two votes for so doing: but
meanwhile other members had come in, a new division was taken, and the
motion was now rejected by a majority of seven. The concurrence of the
Commons, for which the Lords had asked, was not merely refused, but the
Lords were invited to join with the Commons in measures of defence<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>

<p>The Lords felt mortified and injured. They declared the assemblage of
mobs in the vicinity of the two Houses to be a breach of the privileges
of Parliament. Northumberland and Holland, who now themselves desired
a compromise and peace, repaired to head-quarters in order to induce
Essex to move his troops nearer to the capital, to keep the mob in
check, and re-establish the freedom of parliamentary debate. Essex
inclined rather to the side of the Lords, having been offended by the
resolutions in the city in favour of Waller: but this circumstance
furnished the other party with the means of winning him back. When Pym
and some other leading members paid him a visit, to assure him that
Waller should remain dependent on him, Essex once again, as hitherto,
chose to give way to the majority: Pym and his friends maintained the
superiority, but, as one sees, with great difficulty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charles I had directed his arms against Gloucester. The great
importance of this town for the pacification, in a Royalist sense, of
the entire west of England, may be inferred from the King’s having
determined to besiege it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> on hearing that Massey
the governor, who had served under one of the Royalist generals, was
inclined to change sides, in defiance of the advice of most of his
counsellors, and especially of the Queen, who would best have liked
a direct attack on London. The King must soon have become conscious
that he had deceived himself: in reply to his summons he received the
correct answer from the Parliamentary point of view, that he would
be obeyed when his commands were conveyed through the two Houses of
Parliament. The two delegates who brought this message spoke in a rude
and curt tone, and when they left, within a few paces of the King put
on their caps, which bore orange cockades, the colours of Essex<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>.
Bad as the fortifications of Gloucester were, the citizens made a good
stand behind them. The Londoners had never taken so much interest in
the fate of any other city: some closed their shops until the news of
its relief should arrive. The troops which Essex led forth on this
errand were far too numerous and too full of warlike zeal for the King
to resist: they repelled partial attacks without difficulty, and on
September 8 Essex entered Gloucester.</p>

<p>It was generally assumed at the time that if the King, instead of
staying before Gloucester, had marched directly on his divided capital,
he would have made himself master of it. I do not think however that
this is at all certain: London had been fortified on all sides; the
ruling party in Parliament, the magistrates, the Common Council, were
most closely leagued together. At least the King must first have
come to an understanding with Essex, or else the expectations of the
Royalists would probably have been disappointed in London also.</p>

<p>By Rupert’s advice the King threw himself in the way of the returning
army at Newbury, in order to prevent a junction between it and the
forces which had meanwhile been collected by Waller. The Prince’s
cavalry gave fresh proof of their surpassing courage in repeated
and at length successful attacks on the enemy’s horse, who however
on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> occasion fought better than before:
but their onset was completely broken on the rampart of pikes of the
Parliamentary infantry; and this time Essex and Skippon had placed
their artillery with great skill at the points where it would be most
effective. The battle consisted of a series of assaults upon an enemy
arrested on his march, who had taken up a strong position and was
prepared to defend it. The next day Essex expected to be obliged to
cut his way through the Royalist army, but it had retired during the
night: he was able to advance unopposed over the battle-field<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>, and
continued his march to London. The day cost the King some of his best
men, such as Lord Falkland, probably the only one of his contemporaries
in whose praise both parties concurred.</p>

<p>Essex had relieved a town and defeated an attack on his army, but he
had not yet established the superiority of the Parliamentary party.
Exulting in having refuted every slander which ignorant persons had
uttered against him, and probably hoping that this was done once
for all (a hope which is never fulfilled), Essex, in spite of the
advantages which had been gained, declared in the Common Council that,
in his opinion, peace was necessary.</p>

<p>The war had now lasted in England for a year and a half. The capital
still held firmly to the principles of parliamentary right which it
had once adopted, but, as the General observed, the war could not be
continued without the possession of a river of gold. It found its
best support in an association formed in Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and
Cambridgeshire for common defence, under such leaders as Parliament
should appoint: but even here the entire and anxious care of the
Parliamentary party was devoted to preventing the gentry from taking
part with the King. Meanwhile a counter association in the North,
which in fact was the earliest of all, between the counties of
Northumberland, Cumberland, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> Westmoreland,
had been formed under the Earl of Newcastle in favour of the King:
a similar one was even then being arranged between Cornwall and
Devonshire, which rejected all commands issued without the personal
participation of the King. In the former region, the important city of
York, where the Royalist resistance had originated, had been confirmed
in its attitude by Newcastle’s victories: in the latter, Prince Maurice
of the Palatinate had just taken the strong town of Exeter. In Dorset
the Parliament had only a couple of fishing villages left; in Somerset
and Wilts not a foot of land; in Hampshire all the people were on
the King’s side. In the midland counties, Nottingham and Lincoln,
from which the King had been obliged to retire a year earlier, his
superiority was indisputable: in Northampton his party was at least
equal in strength to that of the Parliament; Bedford was occupied by
Prince Rupert in October. There was a plan for a rising of the King’s
adherents in Kent, where they had hitherto been with difficulty kept
down; and this it was hoped would have an effect on London.</p>

<p>In addition to these advantages peace had been restored in Ireland.
In May 1642 a synod assembled at Kilkenny had given the country an
independent organisation: a council of twenty-four members, in which
the four archbishops sat, was appointed to direct public affairs.
This council entered into communication with Pope Urban VIII, who was
greatly pleased that the land of saints should be purged of heretics.
Through the dissensions that had broken out between the King and the
Parliament, the English forces could achieve nothing in Ireland; it was
expected that in a short time all the surviving Protestants would be
at the mercy, or the unmercifulness, of the Irish rebels. Moreover the
principles of the Parliament at Westminster were by no means entirely
dominant among the Protestants in Ireland: on the contrary the King
had still power enough to remove from their offices men who professed
such opinions, and to replace them with his own adherents. A moderate
middle party was formed, in which the Earl of Ormond was the chief
personage. Between these however and the united Catholics there was no
irreconcileable breach, as the Catholics continued to treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1643.</span> the King as their sovereign lord, whose prerogative they
were ready to defend against all the world. Thus it became possible in
September 1643 for a truce to be agreed on between the two parties. The
Catholics granted the King a subsidy of £30,000.</p>

<p>A great prospect was opened besides by the death of Cardinal Richelieu,
and soon afterwards of Louis XIII. The Cardinal towards the end of his
life had again begun to exhibit some sympathy for Queen Henrietta; but
she might expect much more now that her old friend, Queen Anne, was
Regent of France. The party which immediately rose to power was the one
to which the Queen herself had belonged. Moreover Charles I expected
arms, money, and even men from the King of Denmark<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>.</p>

<p>It was in fact doubtful whether Parliament would not be obliged to
yield to a combination of so many hostile forces: it had already,
feeling this, renewed its dealings with the Scottish Covenanters.</p>

<span class="small">FRESH INTERFERENCE OF THE SCOTS. CAMPAIGN OF 1644.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We must again turn our attention to the affairs of Scotland, and the
internal struggles there. In the autumn of 1641 the King had made
his comprehensive concessions to the Scots, in order to obtain their
neutrality in his contest with the English Parliament. He thought
he had personally made sure of the leading Covenanters, whom his
concessions chiefly benefited. They had promised to live and die
for him, in matters of temporal authority, and not to interfere in
ecclesiastical disputes, in spite of their sympathies in favour
of uniformity, except when he himself desired it<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>. For as he
attributed his previous misfortunes to the alliance of the Scots and
the English, he calculated on being strong enough, by satisfying the
former, to resist the latter. Hence came his unyielding demeanour at
the end of the year 1641, his departure from the capital, whereby he
thought to secure a retreat into Scotland in case of necessity, and
even the resolution to take up arms. Hamilton, who had been restored
to favour, and for a long time had occupied his seat in the English
Upper House, was one of the lords who assembled round the King at York,
and strengthened him in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> unconciliatory
attitude. He then hastened into Scotland to exert his newly recovered
influence there for the maintenance of a good understanding with the
King. He was never weary of reminding men like Argyle and Loudon that
they themselves and the Scots in general were pledged to the King, that
he had fallen into all his difficulties through them, and that it would
redound to their everlasting honour if they rescued him from them. It
appears that their representations were not altogether fruitless. The
two other leaders at least assented to his wish that the Queen should
come to Scotland. The Privy Council, which conducted the government
there, had been for a long time more favourable to the King than to the
Parliament.</p>

<p>Had the Scottish aristocracy, like the English, sided <i>en masse</i>
with the King, the monarchy would have been established throughout
Great Britain on the old basis.</p>

<p>But the religious difficulty had made this impossible: for the
difference between the English and Scottish nobility lay in the fact
that the latter had abolished Episcopacy, while the former wished
to maintain it, at least in England. Some Scots, for instance the
Hamiltons, would have agreed to this, but by no means all. The
Presbyterian clergy, on the contrary, were of the opinion, and
expressed it with public authority in the General Assembly, that
Episcopacy must be rooted out in England also, if the work of God was
to be finished. Moreover the ruling grandees were afraid that the
King would revoke all his concessions, as soon as he again obtained
power<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>; they feared in that case to see their enemies exalted, for
the old schism of the nobility was still in full operation. Argyle’s
party could not go on long with the Hamiltons, when these drew together
again.</p>

<p>It is intelligible that in this condition of the public mind every
event in England should react on Scotland. The first encounter of the
two parties took place at a sitting of the Privy Council in December
1642. The question was, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> of two opposing
declarations made by the King and the English Parliament, which had
been communicated together at the sitting, only the first, that of the
King, or both alike should be printed. Hamilton and Lanerick observed
that they owed duty to the King, but none to Parliament, and that the
question was whether they would obey him or not. Argyle and Balmerino
would not hear of commands and obedience in this tone, which would
be reverting to the state of things in the old episcopal times. At
this moment the Hamilton party was still the stronger: eleven members
against nine determined that the King’s declaration should be printed,
and not that of the Parliament<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>.</p>

<p>In the state of parties this resolution of course created a great
sensation. It implied a leaning towards the King’s cause on the part
of the Scottish government, which was highly offensive to the earnest
Covenanters. It was a trumpet-blast, says Baillie, which awoke us all.</p>

<p>The gentry of Fife, the most zealously Presbyterian association among
the laity, flocked up to urge a repeal of the resolution; and similar
petitions poured in from other counties, which were supported by many
of the presbyteries. In pursuance of an act of Parliament, a new
committee, called conservators of the peace, had just then been called
into existence, and most of its members were Covenanters: in concert
with them and the church commission, the Privy Council was obliged
to declare that its publication of the King’s declaration implied no
agreement with it: and the Parliamentary declaration had now to be
printed also.</p>

<p>The matter was not ended yet: the fear gained ground that this
resolution was only the first step to a greater scheme; that it would
be proposed to arm for the King; that all the violent Royalists, the
old Bonders, would be called upon to destroy the good patriots, their
opponents<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>.</p>

<p>The zealous Presbyterians spoke in a tone from which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1643.</span> King’s friends gathered that they would probably side with
the Parliament against the King. To counteract this the Hamiltons
put in circulation a petition in which they expressed their strong
desire for ecclesiastical uniformity with England, but with the double
limitation, first that they had no right to force on a neighbouring
kingdom any forms of worship, on which only the legal authority could
decide, and next that the league with England did not set the Scots
free from the duty which bound them to their hereditary king<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.
Instead of quieting opposition, this petition only made it more
vehement. For the Church valued the advancement of religion far more
highly than any political interest, and thought itself justified by
treaty in establishing ecclesiastical uniformity at any price, and
even imposing it on the King. The petition was denounced in sermons,
and signing it declared to be a crime: the church commission caused a
counter declaration containing very violent language to be read from
the pulpits.</p>

<p>There was a feeling throughout the country as though the outbreak of a
new war was at hand: in February 1643 the noise of drums was believed
to have been heard, and contending armies seen, in the air<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>. ‘Our
neighbours’ houses are on fire,’ says Baillie, ‘and we already perceive
in our own the smell of the burning.’</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, through the influence of Argyle’s adherents and
the Church, a deputation waited on the King, to urge him immediately
to summon a Scottish Parliament, and to make an attempt at mediation
between him and the English Parliament.</p>

<p>The King rejected both suggestions, saying that he would abide by the
arrangement already made for triennial parliaments, and that he would
not allow his subjects in one kingdom to interfere in his differences
with the other. Still he aimed at quieting the agitation of the Scots
by his representations and by convincing them of his good intentions.
He told them that, so far from attacking parliamentary rights and
the Protestant religion, he was defending both, the former against a
faction which had expelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> most of the members
of both Houses, and the latter against Anabaptist sectaries. The
Hamiltons were still confident that, if only all the King’s adherents
who were now with him came back at the right moment, they would have
a majority in the next Assemblies. Hamilton and Montrose went to meet
the Queen on her arrival in the north of England. Montrose represented
to her that the interference of the Scots on behalf of the English
Parliament was as good as decided, and that its evil consequences could
only be averted by organising, under royal authority, an attack on the
Covenanters in Scotland itself. Hamilton declared that Scotland could
be held to its allegiance without bloodshed: was he really persuaded
of this, or, as was said at the time, was he unable to come to an
agreement with Montrose as to the command of a Royalist army?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three leading commissions,—the conservators of the
peace, the church commissioners, and a third for taxation,—united,
not without the previous sanction of the Privy Council, for care was
taken whenever possible to maintain legal forms: on being apprised
of the King’s refusal to summon a parliament, they proceeded to take
counsel how this might be met, and formed a determination which was
the completion of their earlier steps tending towards the independence
of the Estates. Relying on some rather dubious precedents of earlier
times, they held that they had the power to summon an Assembly of the
Estates without the King, which they designated a Convention. Hamilton
declared this to be a breach of their agreement with the King: the
crown advocate, Thomas Hope, contested the legality of the measure: it
was however accepted, and that before the King’s friends arrived from
England, ‘since the importance of the matter in question so required’:
the writs were at once issued under the Great Seal, which had already
in Scotland been removed from the King’s personal disposal.</p>

<p>Just at this time the proposal was made at Westminster to enter into
a new alliance with the Scots: messages relating to an embassy to be
despatched for this purpose were exchanged between the two Houses<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>.
Long before this, Pym,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> who always maintained a
good understanding with Argyle, had been heard to assert confidently
that the Scots were ready to come to the help of Parliament. After all
that had passed it might be assumed that there was an agreement between
the leaders of the parties in the two countries.</p>

<p>Among the deputies who went to Scotland for the purpose of forming a
new alliance, the most active and important was Henry Vane the younger,
not exactly a man of strict Presbyterian principles: indeed most of
the leading men were not at heart devoted to them, though at this
time, more than at any other, they mounted Presbyterian colours. On
June 12 an assembly of persons spiritual and temporal was convoked at
Westminster, to reorganise the constitution of the Church and public
worship on principles opposed to those of the bishops, and the Scots
were invited to take part in it. Nothing could have afforded greater
satisfaction to their religious pride, or offered a more lively
incentive to their ecclesiastical ambition<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.</p>

<p>The Convention of the Scottish Estates met on June 22, at Edinburgh,
side by side with the Committees which had summoned it. The Hamiltons
had obtained the subsequent recognition of the Convention by the
King, on condition that it confined its attention to certain points
only, relating mainly to pecuniary differences between the two
countries. The first question which the Assembly had to determine
was whether or not it would acknowledge this limitation,—a point of
immense constitutional importance, as it involved the maintenance or
abandonment of its personal dependence on the King. The Hamiltons tried
to show that the Assembly would be null and void if it overstepped the
prescribed limits<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>. On the other side it was maintained that the
authority of the Great Seal sufficed for subjects. On a division the
Assembly by a large majority declared that it formed a free Convention.
From among the gentry only a single member declared for the Hamiltons;
but they found more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> support among the nobility,
eighteen of whom maintained the view that the Assembly was altogether
bound by the King’s writ: even these however did not venture on
a direct protest, but contented themselves with expressing their
disapproval and staying away from the sittings.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that in spite of all concessions there was again
in existence in Scotland an Assembly opposed to the royal will, having
unlimited claims, which it held to be grounded in right, and formed on
purpose to proceed to the very measure which the King had sought to
obviate by his compliance, a new alliance with England. We need not
assert positively that at the time when these promises were made to the
King there was any intention of violating them: only they were not so
precise as to close every loophole. Obedience and loyalty were not the
feelings which swayed men’s minds: altered relations had brought other
sentiments.</p>

<p>Special considerations were urged in support of the general intention.
The war between the two parties in England, it was observed, threatened
the Scottish frontiers, and nothing could secure their territorial
interests but a new advance into England: this could not be done in
alliance with the King, because he was too poor, but might well be done
in league with the Parliament: neutrality at any rate could not be
maintained. Moreover the advantages gained at this moment by the royal
army in England were watched with considerable apprehension, since the
King was still surrounded by the men against whom the Scots had from
the first contended, and if he again became master, he would be sure
to find a pretext for revoking all that he had granted to the Scots,
and avenging himself on those who had deprived him of the possession of
power<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus all motives alike,—religious, territorial, and even pecuniary
interests, fear of the immediate success of the royal arms and
the effects of this in the future, the hatred and jealousy of
faction,—combined to urge the Scots to accept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1643.</span> English proposals. They acted in this, even from their own point
of view, without thorough foresight: there were other powers in England
besides the King and Parliament by which their political and religious
independence might be endangered. They were not quite blind to this
fact, but as usual only the nearest and most direct interests came
fully within their horizon.</p>

<p>Never perhaps were the plenipotentiaries sent to ask for assistance
expected with greater eagerness by those who were to grant the help
than the English on this occasion by the Scots: the General Assembly,
which had just met, regarded it as a grievance that they were kept
waiting. At last came the news that they had landed at Leith (Aug. 6),
for, as was to be expected, they had made the journey by sea. They
were received with the same forms as the Scottish commissioners in
London: they were to communicate not directly with the two Assemblies,
but with a commission appointed from these for the purpose. On August
9 they produced their instructions, which were to the effect that the
two nations should jointly take up arms against a Popish and prelatical
faction, and not lay them down until the faction was disarmed and
subjected to the authority of Parliament in both nations, the army of
the Scots to be paid out of the revenues of the malignants under the
control of Parliament. It was especially urged that otherwise the good
beginnings of a new church organisation in England must necessarily be
interrupted through the strength of the enemy: against this danger the
English Parliament desired the prayers of the General Assembly, and
above all their co-operation by effective means.</p>

<p>It was evident from the negotiations that the English cared most for
the political, the Scots for the religious connexion. The English gave
way to most of the demands of the Scots, seeing clearly that without
this nothing would be attainable; and especially on the following
point. The Scots would not allow what the King had said, as to his
being chiefly opposed by the separatist sects, to be applied to them,
and rejected every allusion to those sects. One such allusion might
originally have been found in the words which were approved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1643.</span> in the treaty, that the parties pledged themselves to a
reformation of the Church of England according to the Word of God:
for a great deal might be deduced from these words. The Scots however
anticipated any explanation of this kind, by insisting on its being
expressly added that the reformation should be made on the model of the
best reformed Churches, and that the Churches in the three kingdoms
should be brought into the closest connexion and uniformity in respect
of doctrine, discipline, and public worship. Nothing in fact was to
be expected but the extension of the Scottish system to the other two
kingdoms. The abolition of the prelacy in all its branches, and the
punishment of all malignants, were expressly stipulated. Thereupon they
promised<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> to defend the privileges of Parliament and the liberties
of the realms, unanimously and heartily, with body and goods, in every
place, reserving however the rightful authority of the King. The Scots
felt the danger of the alliance into which they were again entering.
Just at this time arrived the news of the fall of Bristol, which made
a profound impression: it was, says Baillie<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>, a great act of
faith, a high courage, unexampled sympathy, that our people endangered
its own peace, and ventured life and all to save a nation which in
every man’s eyes was already lost. We cannot doubt that religious
conviction had much to do with this. When the moderator in the General
Assembly produced the draft of the Covenant between the two nations,
worthy, wise, and aged men were seen to burst into tears of religious
satisfaction and joy. The draft was again read, and every one invited
to express his opinion upon it. Though here and there dissentient views
were uttered, they were stated with so much reservation, that the
adoption of the Covenant may be regarded as unanimous. The religious
zealots saw with delight that the great neighbouring kingdom would
accept their church system, and greeted as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span>
good omen the coincidence that the abolition of Episcopacy in England
was now decided on the same day of the month on which, four years
before, the same thing had been done in Scotland. It was a momentous
step, to advance from a system of defence to one of proselytising,
and if it failed, would bring on their heads all the vicissitudes
of the war: but the Scots took it boldly. The Convention, like the
Assembly, adopted the New Covenant, and before it separated published a
proclamation by which every man between the ages of sixteen and sixty
was required to hold himself ready to appear in the field fully armed,
within twenty-four hours after the summons thereto should be issued.</p>

<p>After the English Parliament, which in this matter was guided by the
Assembly of Divines at Westminster, had accepted the Covenant with few
and insignificant alterations, the oath to maintain it was solemnly
taken in the church at Edinburgh by the committee of the General
Assembly and the Convention, and by the English deputies. This was on a
Friday: the next Sunday the Covenant was recommended to the people from
the pulpits, and signed and sworn to by all. Similar scenes took place
in London. On September 25 the Covenant was read from the pulpit of St.
Margaret’s, Westminster, the numerous congregation raising their hands
in token of assent. Then the parchment roll on which it was inscribed
was signed first by the members of the Assembly of Divines and the
Scottish Commissioners, and then, after blessing had been pronounced,
by the members of the two Houses of Parliament: this was repeated in
the churches of the capital and of the counties in the power of the
Parliament<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>. It was the first act in which the union of the two
kingdoms took effect. What the King and his bishops had failed to
accomplish was thus achieved by John Pym and the Presbyterian preachers.</p>

<p>The alliance of the two countries was the work above all of John Pym.
With him had originated, or at any rate had found conscious expression,
the idea of giving life to the opposition in England by means of
an understanding with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> the Scots. He above
all men had contrived the coincidence, which at the outset decided
everything, between the first Scottish invasion and the election of
a thorough opposition Parliament. It may be true, as has been said,
that he took no such keen interest as others in uprooting the bishops
on grounds of doctrine: but this was the object which united Scottish
and English Puritans, and these again with the daily increasing
Independents. He adopted it as a great political necessity, and held
to it firmly, although the English revolution was thus led far beyond
its original aim. His views were directed not to the restoration of
equilibrium between the Crown and Parliament, but to the establishment
of the completed preponderance of the Parliamentary power, and this
implied the subjection of the spiritual element also. The alliance of
the Puritan and Parliamentary ideas both answered this purpose and
supplied the means for carrying it out. Parliament was connected with
the disaffection of the city through religious ideas. John Pym was the
originator of the tactics which called upon the masses at the decisive
moments of parliamentary contests; he knew how to back the aspirations
of the faction which he led by the regular recurrence of tumultuous
popular demonstrations in the great capital. On his connexion with
London he based his audacious resolve to deprive royalty, in which the
power of the conqueror was perpetuated, of the arms which constituted
its splendour and greatness. In order to obtain power to bring into the
field for this purpose a popular army, without being dependent on the
voluntary assent of every single man, he adopted the decisive means of
taxing the necessaries of life: for he was a financier by profession,
and was the first to introduce excise into England. In other political
measures he derived encouragement and example from the Scots, with
whose chief leaders he always maintained close relations. This was
indispensable for both parties, not only as against the King and his
declared adherents, but also against the moderate party which desired
a peaceful solution. When Pym and his friends again had to fear the
superior power of the King they did not hesitate once more to call in
the Scots, though some objection was felt to them on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1643.</span> account of their exclusive Presbyterianism; and Argyle, who
could not endure friendly relations between the King and the country,
because this would raise his own immediate rivals to importance, came
forward to meet him, in order by this means to overcome them. Argyle
and Pym joined hands across a wide expanse. While everything was being
prepared for carrying out the New Covenant, John Pym died (Dec. 6,
1643), worn out by the fearful efforts of the war, by the exciting
alternations of danger and success, of defeat and victory. He possessed
talents created for times of revolution, capable at once of shaking
and destroying existing institutions and of establishing new ones,
as resolute in passing great measures as in devising small means:
audacious in his projects, but practical in executing them, at once
active and unyielding, bold and prudent, systematic and pliant, full of
thought for his friends, devoid of all consideration for those against
whose rights he was battling. In Pym there is something both of Sieyès
and of Mirabeau: he is one of the greatest revolutionary leaders known
to history. Characters like his stand midway between the present, which
they shatter for ever, and the future, which however generally develops
itself on principles different from those which they have laid down.
The parliamentary and religious system of John Pym failed to establish
itself, but its influence is nevertheless immeasurable: it consists in
the opposition offered to the combination in royalty of spiritual and
political tendencies, in the crown being brought back into the track of
parliamentary government, in the preparation made for the fusion of the
English and Scottish nationalities. Pym before his death had prepared
everything for a new advance in the great contest. By his activity
a considerable payment had been made to the Scots on account of the
original cost of arming and of the subsidies (£31,000 monthly) which
had been promised to them, so that the levies there were progressing
satisfactorily. The Scots had promised to take the field with 18,000
foot soldiers and 3000 cavalry, and were now ready in spite of the hard
winter to cross the border. Meanwhile two new armies had been raised
in England besides that of Essex, one under Waller, for which new
levies in Sussex and Kent were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1643.</span> appointed, and
the other under Kimbolton (Mandeville), who now since the death of his
father appears as Lord Manchester, in the associated eastern counties.</p>

<p>The King had but one possible resource in the world to oppose to these
accessions of strength to his enemies. He might have done what he was
always given credit for wishing to do, namely, make a league with
the Irish rebels, who fully recognised his prerogative in respect to
England and were willing to maintain it. But this was impossible after
the Irish massacre: the King would have raised against him the entire
Anglo-Saxon and Protestant element, on which after all his crown as
it was depended. At least he could never venture publicly to concede
to the supreme council of the Irish full religious liberty, although
personally he would have been inclined to do so. A few regiments came
to his assistance from Ireland, but they were Protestants, no longer
required there after the truce that had been agreed on. They were
distributed among the different royal corps, and proved very useful:
among other things they were present when Prince Rupert raised the
siege of Newark, a step absolutely necessary for the maintenance of
communications between Oxford and York: but this was very little in
comparison with the aid afforded to the other side by the Scots.</p>

<p>The King was not without some sources of assistance in Scotland itself.
He had long hesitated between Hamilton and Montrose, but was also
induced by the course of events to give the preference to the latter.
Hamilton, whom the court accused of treason, when he came to Oxford
to defend himself, was arrested and imprisoned: the King assented,
though unwillingly, and without being convinced of his guilt; for some
of his firmest adherents openly threatened that otherwise they would
quit him<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>. While Hamilton was expiating his dubious politics in a
castle in Cornwall, Montrose, who had also come to Oxford, was made
Lieutenant-General of the King’s forces which had been, or hereafter
should be, levied in Scotland. There was still, as we know, a Royalist
party in Scotland, not only in the north, where here and there men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> deemed it an honour to be classed among the
malignants, but also in the central counties. Montrose was fully
determined to unite these round his standard.</p>

<p>It is astonishing that the King, in spite of all the hostility
exhibited toward him by the English Parliament—of which he regarded
the renewed alliance with the Scots as one of the greatest proofs—did
not even now take the step of declaring it dissolved. His reason was
that this would have been to retract a concession solemnly made, and so
to give occasion for doubt as to the validity of all the other statutes
passed by this Parliament, many of which his own adherents would not
surrender. As always, when between opposing and irreconcilable views,
Charles I adopted a middle course. He declared that, in consequence of
the tumults that had taken place in the previous July, the Parliament
at Westminster was no longer a free Parliament, and summoned to Oxford
all who had been expelled or who had fled from Westminster, in order to
form out of them an assembly which should represent a free Parliament.
There were 83 of the Lords, 175 of the Commons, a far greater number
than remained at Westminster. On January 22, 1643/4, the King opened
the sittings at Oxford.</p>

<p>Declaration was at once made here, in a form corresponding to ancient
custom, that the proceedings of the Scots were to be treated as a
declaration of war, and their invasion of English territory as an
actual commencement of war and a breach of the treaty, and consequently
that all Englishmen who should favour or assist their expedition were
traitors and enemies of the country<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>. The Parliament at Westminster
itself was in this case. After the Chancellor of the Exchequer had
produced his budget, votes were taken for the necessary subsidies and
for new taxes: and here, as in Edinburgh and London, recourse was had
to the excise. The declaration was repeated with special emphasis that
the King had taken up arms only in defence, for the maintenance of
the Protestant religion, the laws of the land and the privileges of
Parliament. If Charles I meant nothing more than to assert the nullity
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> the Parliament at Westminster, without
pronouncing its dissolution and rescinding the acts by virtue of which
it had sat so long, he had attained his end, but he could expect to
produce no further result. The question which of the two Parliaments
was to be deemed the rightful one, must be decided by the sword.</p>

<p>The King could only reckon on his old adherents and the forces already
raised, when in the spring of 1644 this double storm began to break
over him.</p>

<p>We will direct our attention first to the King’s campaign against the
Parliamentary army under Essex and Waller, and then to the events
consequent on the Scottish invasion.</p>

<p>The first began with gloomy forebodings—so much so that the Queen,
then near her confinement, hastened to quit Oxford and resort to
Exeter, as a place where she would be safer—and at great disadvantage.</p>

<p>The King was only able to bring into the field 10,000 men to encounter
the two armies which were set in motion under Essex and Waller at
the beginning of May, each of which was about 10,000 strong. Prince
Rupert had recommended that the infantry should be distributed in the
fortified places in front—Reading, Abingdon, Wallingford, Oxford,
Banbury; and that the cavalry should join the troops in the western
counties, so that while one of the Parliamentary armies was occupied
with the siege of those places, they might be a match for the other
in the open field<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. The council of war however which surrounded
the King, and in which some members of the Privy Council, Digby and
Colepepper, took part, could not resolve on this course, preferring to
abandon some of the fortresses and unite their garrisons with the field
force, in the hope that the latter would succeed in compelling the
two Parliamentary armies, whose commanders it was well known did not
agree, to fight separately from each other. The Royal troops abandoned
first Reading and then Abingdon, and moved on Oxford to wait for their
opportunity. The immediate consequences however were not what was
expected. Both the Parliamentary generals advanced towards Oxford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> and though they were not altogether on good
terms, co-operated effectually with one another. While Waller forced
the passage of the Isis, Essex could not be kept beyond the Cherwell:
both marched on the city, which was all the less ready for resistance
because it was not provisioned for receiving so large a garrison. The
report was spread abroad that the King was already a prisoner: the
Parliament issued a decree relating to this possibility—we learn that
even in the King’s own neighbourhood it was regarded as unavoidable. He
was urged to treat in time with Essex, for otherwise he would become
his prisoner. The King replied that it was possible this might happen,
but at least he would not survive it<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>. He was determined, whatever
might be the consequences, to try the fortune of war once more in the
open field.</p>

<p>After taking the most urgent precautions for the defence of Oxford, he
moved from thence with most part of his troops. He succeeded in fact in
passing between the two hostile armies, which still remained separate:
on June 6, four days after he started, he arrived with a few followers
at Worcester, by way of Burford and Evesham.</p>

<p>What he had originally expected now took place: the two hostile armies
separated. Essex would not be prevented from advancing into the western
counties, where he hoped for great successes: the King had only Waller
to deal with.</p>

<p>He would not let himself be shut up in Worcester, as Waller attempted,
holding it to be essentially dishonourable for a King to be besieged,
and moved farther northwards. While Waller followed in the same
direction, the King succeeded in turning back, so that what was then
taking place in the German war between Torstenson and Gallas, that
sometimes one, sometimes the other was in advance, was repeated on a
smaller scale in England. On June 16 we find the King on the heights
of Camden, then at Witney near Oxford, where important reinforcements
hastened to meet him. Surrounded by a pretty considerable army he could
think of advancing on London, where a bold stroke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1644.</span> would revive the dormant Royalist sympathies: the message had
actually been drawn up which in that case was to be sent to Parliament.
Waller, who had followed in his track, came up, and an action took
place at Cropredy Bridge, in which the King obtained the advantage.
Waller’s losses were not very severe, but he had lost his field guns
and his most experienced artillery officer, and deemed it well to avoid
another conflict. The King also found it advisable to give his troops
rest and refreshment: then he moved back towards Evesham, in order
not to bring the enemy again upon Oxford by returning thither, and so
endanger it afresh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Essex had made successful progress in his march westward:
he had compelled the Royalist troops to raise the sieges of Lyme
and Plymouth, and had advanced into Cornwall. Quite contrary to his
expectation he there met with determined resistance and outspoken
Royalist sentiments. After the King had refreshed and strengthened
his troops in their quarters, he resolved after some hesitation to go
to the aid of his adherents in that district. His chief motive was
that his wife would now be endangered at Exeter by the proximity of
the enemy. Strengthened by Prince Maurice and Lord Hopton, Charles I
appeared with a very superior force in the rear of Essex, who was now
in painful difficulties. He had neither provisions to maintain his
troops, nor money to pay them: the inhabitants rose against him in all
directions<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>, he could obtain no answer, much less any help from
Parliament, for he had long ago lost the favour of the leading men
there. At this moment, the King, with the assent of the officers of his
army, offered him terms. Essex however was a man of the Parliamentary
majority, to whose principles he held firmly, though now personally
ill-used. He rejected every offer, remaining convinced that the royal
will expressed with the assent of the two Houses was the only thing
binding on him. Still he had no inclination to fight against the King
in person, which besides would then in the condition of his army have
been ruinous. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> resolved to escape to Plymouth
with his chief companions in arms. The Parliamentary cavalry cut their
way through the Royal troops, the infantry capitulated, the artillery
and arms fell into the King’s hands.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1644 was the best success achieved by King Charles I.
The French ambassador, who met him at Evesham and had a long audience
on horseback, cannot praise him sufficiently: he is full, he reports,
of judgment and sagacity, never lets himself be led to any precipitate
action through his dangerous position, orders everything himself, both
great and small, never signs anything that he has not read, and on
horseback or on foot is ever at the head of his troops<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the campaign in the North had taken quite a different
course. At the end of February the Scots crossed the Tyne: the
manner in which they effected the passage did not altogether excite
the admiration of veterans; the soldiers lacked discipline, and the
officers experience<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>. They would with difficulty have held their
ground against the Marquis of Newcastle had they encountered him in
the open field, but they declined to quit their position, which was
rendered unassailable by ditches, hedges, and marsh. The reason for
this was that they could confidently reckon on seeing the troops of the
Parliament approach in a short time from the other side.</p>

<p>By the express orders of the recently formed committee of the two
kingdoms, Thomas Fairfax and his father Ferdinand Lord Fairfax moved
towards them, the former issuing from Lancashire, the latter from Hull.
Colonel Bellasis, who tried to prevent their junction, was surprised
at Selby, defeated and taken prisoner,—a success in itself of no
immediate importance, yet one for which Parliament was right to order
a thanksgiving, for the Marquis of Newcastle was thereby compelled
to retreat in order to cover York. The Scots could now advance from
their position, and on April 20, Lesley Earl of Leven, joined the two
Fairfaxes at Tadcaster.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> And as the levies of
the united counties now appeared under Lord Manchester on the northern
border of their own district, the three corps were able to undertake
the formal investment of York, so that on June 16 an assault was made
on the ramparts.</p>

<p>York was the second city of the kingdom, the place where the Royalist
party had first made head: the whole of the North depended on it. The
King durst not leave it without assistance: he requested his nephew
Prince Rupert to abandon every other scheme and proceed immediately to
the relief of York. If York fell, his crown was as good as lost: the
only hope he had of retaining it lay in relieving York and defeating
the rebel army which was besieging it. He conjured him by his duty and
affection to accomplish this work without delay<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.</p>

<p>The prince was then at the zenith of his military fame. After his
fortunate exploit at Newark he had gone to the assistance of the
chivalrous Countess of Derby, who defended her castle of Lathom House,
the walls of which she had herself made defensible, first against
Thomas Fairfax and then against the more vehement attacks of Rigby; and
had compelled the besiegers to relinquish their undertaking. They moved
to Bolton, one of the chief seats of English Puritanism, and this place
also was captured by Rupert. Then he advanced upon Liverpool, which
fell into his hands without resistance. Now he was summoned by the
King’s letter to the most important operation with which he could ever
be entrusted, for on its result the issue of the war mainly depended.</p>

<p>With a force which had been regarded as insignificant, but which had
now grown, through all the additions that had been made to it, to 8,000
horse and 10,000 foot-soldiers, Rupert at the end of June crossed the
hills which separate Lancashire and Yorkshire: his arrival and name
immediately produced a great effect. The united army of the English and
Scots quitted its lines before York, and took up a position to bar his
advance: but he avoided it, and entered York as a deliverer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span>

<p>The arrival of these tidings filled the King’s camp with joy: it seemed
now as if everything would end fortunately. In London men went about
with bowed heads: it was thought probable that Rupert would unite with
the King for an attack on the united counties, on the possession of
which the military operations on the side of the Parliament were mainly
based. It was believed that Newcastle, even without Rupert, would be
able to maintain himself in Yorkshire, and make head against the united
generals, between whom no very good understanding prevailed.</p>

<p>Never in truth would it have been wiser to avoid a decisive battle
than at that moment, looking at the relative positions of the two
contending forces. But it was of the very nature of the Royalist
enthusiasm to thirst for great battles. Prince Rupert in particular
thought that nothing had been done so long as the enemy stood before
him unconquered. He held that the King’s letter not only empowered,
but instructed him to fight: in conjunction with the troops that were
in York he thought himself strong enough to win a victory. The Marquis
of Newcastle combated the proposal, but Rupert persisted: the Marquis
would not, though he disliked it, appear to be overruled; he said that
he had no other ambition than to be a loyal subject, and joined the
Prince with his brave white-coats, and every man that could be spared
from York.</p>

<p>The war had by this time assumed a terrible aspect. The Parliament
declared the troops who had come over from Ireland to be traitors, and
Essex had those who were taken prisoners executed. Thereupon Rupert
hanged on the nearest trees an equal number of those who had fallen
into his hands. Often if the Roundheads on one day obtained admission
into a country house, on the next it was reduced to ruins by the
Cavaliers. A horrible massacre had even now been impending over the
Puritans at Bolton: one party wished to avenge, the other to continue
it.</p>

<p>Thus all these feelings of hatred and revenge were added to the natural
spirit of warfare—they must and would fight.</p>

<p>On July 2, 1644, the two armies met at Long Marston Moor. Each of them
numbered about 20,000 men, every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> of whom
had chosen his side and knew what he was fighting for. The battle cry
of the one side was ‘God and the King’; for they wished to maintain
the ancient constitution under princes ruling by divine right: that of
the other was ‘God with us’; for in them religious motives superseded
all others, they would have no prince who imposed any restrictions in
this respect. The engagement did not actually begin until 7 p.m. At
first the battle seemed likely to have a similar result to most of the
previous ones. The right wing of the Parliamentary army, led forward to
the attack by Thomas Fairfax, was repulsed: then the Royalist cavalry
under the command of Goring dashed with redoubled fury on the enemy’s
centre, chiefly composed of Scots, and broke it after a vigorous
resistance: old Alexander Lesley, who had striven in vain to rally his
troops, at last himself took to flight. A very different result awaited
the encounter on the left wing, which had some Scots in the reserve,
but otherwise was entirely composed of Englishmen, the core of it being
the cuirassiers raised by Cromwell in the united counties. ‘Is Cromwell
here?’ asked Prince Rupert of a prisoner, for he already recognised
him as his most dangerous opponent. Against this cavalry Rupert now
led his own men—veterans, crowned with victory, whom no enemy had yet
withstood, against newly-formed and untried troops. If we set aside
the boastings and the apologies of the rival parties, we shall discern
that this was the decisive moment of the war. The Royalists on this
day had adopted a change of tactics; in order to give their cavalry
more mobility for attacking the Scottish infantry, they had separated
the regiments into squadrons, which may have been an advantage against
infantry, but was injurious when they were opposed to a compact and
coherent mass of horsemen<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>. The attack thus weakened encountered
the fierce resistance of the newly-formed Parliamentary cavalry, whose
success had a decisive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> effect over the whole
battle-field. ‘We drove’, says Cromwell, ‘the entire cavalry of the
Prince off the field; God made them as stubble before our sword. Then
we attacked their regiments of foot with our cavalry, and overthrew
all that we encountered.’ The slaughter was deadly, for Cromwell had
forbidden quarter being given. Newcastle’s white-coats fell in their
ranks as they stood. The King’s troops sustained an annihilating
defeat. The Marquis of Newcastle would not appear before his party as
a defeated man, to see the admiration which he had hitherto merited
change into scorn or pity: he took ship the next day for Hamburg.
The remains of the army gathered round Prince Rupert, who retreated
into Lancashire. The capital of the Royalists, the ancient city of
York, fell into the hands of the allied generals, who by their union
became masters of the North of England. The Scots set forth to occupy
Newcastle.</p>

<p>If the royal cause did not even yet seem to be utterly ruined it
was because of the great success which Charles I had achieved in
Cornwall. He still maintained his ground. On his return towards Oxford,
Manchester and Waller met him at Newbury with a superior force: the
King was in personal danger and had to quit the battle-field; just
afterwards however he succeeded in relieving Deddington, which was
besieged by the Parliamentary army.</p>

<p>In November Charles I returned to Oxford. Neither he himself nor his
followers had lost courage. The loss of the North was to a certain
extent compensated by the possession of the West. Others however
thought it impossible that he should make head against the superior
forces of Parliament, strengthened by their alliance with the
Scots<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>.</p>

On the Royalist side Newcastle was originally blamed (A. Trevor, in
Carte’s Letters i. 58), then Byron, who actually suggested the attack
on Cromwell (Rupert’s Diary). The Scots praise Lindsay, Eglinton, above
all David Lesley. The Presbyterians defend Fairfax. Cromwell is however
praised even by those who were not Independents, as the author of the
victory.</p>

<span class="small">PREPONDERANCE OF THE SCOTS. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ENGLISH ARMY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Scots, there is no doubt, had again contributed decisively to
the change of fortune, and therefore a great influence on the course
of affairs necessarily fell into their hands. Immediately after the
arrival of the Scottish commissioners the Committee of the two kingdoms
was established, a body which in fact expressed this relation. Loudon
and Warriston had devised the scheme: it was first discussed and
shaped in consultation with the younger Vane and Oliver St. John,
and then brought before Parliament. The Committee was to direct its
attention to the maintenance of a good understanding within the three
kingdoms, as well as with foreign powers, and especially in all that
related to the war in which they were engaged, not only to advise and
consult, but to order and regulate<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>. These words excited vigorous
opposition in the Lords: they were unwilling to commit the direction
of affairs to a Committee which consisted partly of Scots, and which
would deprive Parliament of the ultimate decision, and they also did
not wish to place the Earl of Essex, who hitherto had maintained great
independence in the command of his army, as was allowed to a general
in those days, under the direction of a Committee. The Scots however
insisted on their views in a forcible memorial, and were backed by
the Lower House. For it was obvious that the war could not be carried
on by the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> nations in conformity with the
single end in view, nor could their forces co-operate, unless they were
under a single authority, which was impossible without a Committee of
both nations. Nor could such a Committee be in its turn subject to
Parliament: the Upper House was informed that unless it assented the
war would have to be carried on without the two Houses of Parliament.
After unusually active opposition, repeated divisions, and several
conferences, the Lords gave way. The Committee was entrusted with the
required full powers: it comprised seven Lords and fourteen of the
Commons. We find Presbyterian names not only among the former, where
they preponderated, but also among the latter. Manchester, Warwick,
Essex, Northumberland, appear among the former, the two Vanes,
Stapleton, St. John, Haslerig, Oliver Cromwell, among the latter. The
resolutions were in general passed by a very small number of votes<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the papers of the interregnum preserved in the English archives
is a collection of the resolutions of this Committee. They refer to
the maintenance of communication between the armies, to the furnishing
of supplies, to the conduct of the war itself, both in England and
Ireland. Sometimes they are very precise and stringent. The commanders
of the armies are instructed what troops they are to assemble, whether
they are to oppose the King or Prince Rupert, in what direction they
are to move.</p>

<p>The money requisite for the army was collected by another Committee,
which sat in Goldsmiths’ Hall, and received its powers and instructions
from the English Parliament. The chief source of income was the
property of delinquents<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, for so they termed all who held to the
King in opposition to the resolutions of Parliament: the property was
sold, or the owners compelled to pay a composition, which at times was
very considerable. The Earl of Thanet was condemned to pay a fine of
£20,000, for having aided the King with his plate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1644.</span> and appeared in the field against the Parliament. The offence
imputed to most of them is participation in the war in favour of
the King; but some are condemned for having shown themselves to be
enemies of Parliament and of good men, as the adherents of Parliament
are termed. We know how nearly the Scots were concerned in these
confiscations: when the treaty was concluded attention was expressly
directed to the goods of papists, prelatists, and other malignants, as
being the cause of all mischief<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>.</p>

<p>The Lords opposed the Scottish interest in another affair also. They
asked for a Committee of the two Houses to open peace negotiations
with the King; the Scots maintained that not only no peace could be
concluded without them, but no negotiations could be undertaken, the
two nations being united for peace as well as for war. The Lower House
was not so strong in favour of the Scots this time as formerly: the
votes were equal, but the Speaker, Lenthall, gave his casting vote in
favour of the Scots.</p>

<p>Thorough hostility between the Lords and the Scottish Commissioners
was however not to be expected. Lord Holland,—who had once gone to
the court at Oxford, but being unable to exert any influence there
had returned to the Parliament,—and his friends among the nobility,
desired nothing so much as a treaty with the King, which would secure
them both ways. For already they clearly perceived what would happen to
them if the Lower House persisted in its present course. They greatly
desired the presence of the Scottish Commissioners, and the regard
which must be paid to the Scottish Parliament, as a counterpoise to
their opponents, by whom they were completely overmatched<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.</p>

<p>The Scots thus attained unlimited influence over the conduct of the
war, the negotiations with the King, home and foreign affairs: nothing
could be done without them, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> Committee
of the two kingdoms, in which they had a decisive voice, held the
government in its hands.</p>

<p>They sought especially to strengthen and extend this power, because
they desired, according to the terms of the union, to complete the
Presbyterian system in England, and to establish uniformity.</p>


<h3 id="WESTMINSTER"><i>The Westminster Assembly.</i></h3>

<p>It is obvious at the first glance how great was the difference in this
respect between the two countries. In Scotland the parishes with their
lay elders, the synods and assemblies, were the expression of the
national independence permeated by ecclesiastical ideas: in England
all had to be introduced from above, by the power which held the helm
of state. The Assembly of Divines at Westminster differed equally
widely from a Church assembly in Scotland. The members had been named
by Parliament according, not to dioceses, but to counties: their
resolutions had no force beyond what Parliament chose to give them:
they acted like the disputants in the colloquies of earlier times:
the state reserved to itself its judgment, whether of rejection or of
approval<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Assembly itself these ideas were represented by some members,
the Erastians, who were also regarded as the most learned of all. They
claimed for the state high authority in Church affairs, for which they
regarded the kingship of the Old Testament as the model. They rejected
the right of Church sessions and courts to excommunicate, which formed
the mainspring of their power.</p>

<p>Besides the champions of State-intervention in the Church, there were
other and more dangerous opponents, who asserted the autonomy of all
religious congregations, and their total independence of the State,
even more strongly than the Presbyterians. The Congregationalists, who
appear more definitely as the Independents, formed perhaps a seventh
part of the Assembly. They had become by far the most important
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span> the separatist sects with which the
Presbyterians four years earlier had co-operated.</p>

<p>So far as the overthrow of the episcopal system went, these two parties
were still in accord, and the temporal authority lent its hand to the
work. The pictures were burned in solemn procession, as at Florence in
Savonarola’s time, the organs were destroyed, the episcopalian members
of the colleges in the universities expelled. Under these influences
the prosecution of Archbishop Laud was resumed. The chief accusation
against him was that he had tried to assimilate the English Church
to Popery, and to introduce into it papistical and superstitious
observances. Laud, like Stafford, was condemned by a Bill of Attainder
proceeding from the House of Commons (Nov. 11), and this Bill, though
not without opposition, was accepted by the Lords<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>. After all that
had happened, the King’s sanction was thought to be as little necessary
in this matter as in others.</p>

<p>When the time came for erecting a new edifice on the ground chosen and
levelled for the purpose, the contest between the Presbyterians and
Congregationalists in the Assembly of Divines instantly began. The
latter rejected entirely the system of lay elders, and denied that it
could be proved from Scripture to be a divine institution: they would
allow the consistories neither to ordain nor to excommunicate. In these
institutions they saw nothing but the relics of an old and detestable
system, for the imposition of hands was evidently of a hierarchical
character: if the Reformation was to be complete they must revert to
the original institution of independent churches, each one possessing
the right to govern itself through its elders. They revived the idea
of the first Anabaptists, that the communities should consist of the
faithful only, and that no one could be admitted who had not proved
that he was in true grace. Personal holiness, a blameless life, they
required less strictly than the Puritans; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1644.</span>
they expected a thoroughly Christian disposition which came of grace.
In such a community all clerical elements entirely vanished; it alone
had the power to choose the ministers of the word, or to expel from its
society. One day one of their spokesmen, Nye, declared plainly that the
establishment of a church government extending over the whole country,
even of a national assembly, would have disastrous and terrible
consequences. The Scots were greatly agitated; they would have nothing
more to do with principles so hostile to their own. On this occasion,
as in relation to other differences, they were persuaded to moderate
their anger. The adherents of these opinions were already a power in
the realm: some of the leading members of the Committees were among
them; a breach between the two parties must at any cost be avoided.</p>

<p>In reality it was the political preponderance of the Scots which gave
them the upper hand in the religious strife. There can be no doubt of
this, their own letters assert that their arms had had a large share
in the result<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>. If at first they held back from discussing the
weightiest questions, they declared it was because they wished first
to wait for the advance of their troops: they assert later that their
enemies would go further and occasion greater confusion if not kept in
check by the fear of their army, which had approached meanwhile. It was
due to the necessity of the closest union in a moment of difficulty,
that in May 1644 they obtained the recognition of the principle that
the right of ordination did not belong to any single congregation. At
the same time also they obtained the acceptance of their eucharistic
rite, which was resisted by the Independents.</p>

<p>In the decisive battle of Marston Moor however the Independents also
had a great share. The question which of the two portions of the army
had done best assumed a sort of theological importance. Cromwell
was almost accused of cowardice by the Presbyterians; while the
Independents extolled his merits to the skies.</p>

<p>A committee was appointed to try and smooth over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1644.</span> differences between the Independents and Presbyterians.
The former claimed at least toleration, which seemed to the others
unendurable: the point had already been decided at the conclusion
of the league between the two nations. At that time all objections
had been waived on the English side, in order to gain the religious
sympathies of the Scots. The stronger their influence, the more
firmly they held to their exclusive Presbyterianism. Necessarily the
Independents resisted as much as they could.</p>

<p>The occupation of Newcastle by the Scots, in the name of the English
Parliament, was an event of scarcely less ecclesiastical than military
importance. Once more royalist sentiments were manifested there in
all their strength: all the offers of the Scots were rejected, and
they were obliged to take the place by storm (October 19, 1644.) This
success in the face of a brave resistance raised their own estimate of
their services to England. When they announced their victory to the
Committee of the two kingdoms, they demanded that now the settlement
of public worship should be completed by the Assembly and ratified by
Parliament.</p>

<p>The Independents felt that any resistance would be fruitless; they
assented to the introduction of the Scottish worship, the more so as in
the preface to the new Directory some words were inserted which allowed
rather less strictness in observance without surrendering anything in
principle<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>. Parliament not merely gave its sanction to this new
church order, but unequivocally accepted the forms of Presbyterian
church government, insomuch that in the articles which were to be laid
before the King, the subjection of all congregations to a system of
provincial and national assemblies was made one of the conditions to
which he must assent.</p>

<p>Had things come to this point the entire Scottish church system would
have received legal validity in England also, and the Independents
would have been obliged to disappear like the Episcopalians.</p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span>


<h3 id="UXBRIDGE"><i>The Negotiations at Uxbridge.</i></h3>

<p>The object of the peace negotiations, which after much delay were at
last agreed on, was not only a reconciliation with the King, but also
the establishment of an ecclesiastical and political system complete
at all points. The chief author of the articles produced was the man
who long before had given the most consistency to the revolutionary
movement in Scotland, Johnston of Warriston: he sketched them out in
April 1644, carried them in the Committee, and then went with them to
Scotland, where the Parliament made some few additions, especially
the names of those who were not to be pardoned without the assent of
Parliament. Through his influence the articles with these additions
were accepted, first by the Committee unanimously, and then by the two
Houses. In November they were laid before the King.</p>

<p>The introduction of Presbyterianism, by the acceptance of the Covenant
itself, was insisted on in them more strictly than ever; they also
retained the parliamentary control of the militia, and demanded a
renewal of the war against the Irish<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. What was thought of these
proposals in the outer world is indicated by the observation of the
French ambassador, that Charles I, if he accepted them, might as well
discard the title of King; for under these conditions he would be
scarcely more than the first man in a republic. Charles I’s motive for
entering into negotiations, and even suggesting them through his own
ambassadors, was mainly in order to allow no further ground for the
rumour that he hated peace<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. He hoped that by the discussion of the
articles their inadmissibility would be made manifest.</p>

<p>In the conduct of the negotiations he played a very subordinate part:
Parliament took care to keep the matter entirely in its own hands.
It fixed the place of meeting at the small town of Uxbridge, which
afforded none of the comforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> of life: it
limited the time to twenty days, in reckoning which, it was thought
necessary expressly to provide that the intervening Sundays were not
to be counted: it instructed its representatives (among whom we find,
besides some Lords, and the peacefully-inclined Hollis and Whitelocke,
Vane and St. John, the leaders of the dominant party) in what order
the questions were to be taken, and ordered them not to depart in any
material point from the contents of the original propositions.</p>

<p>The plenipotentiaries of both parties met at Uxbridge towards the end
of January. The Parliamentarians occupied one part, the Royalists the
other, of the little town, and divided the two inns between them: each
party had its separate entrance to the old-fashioned building in which
the meetings were held, and separate chambers to which they might
retire.</p>

<p>At times however they met by the fireside, and the visits which they
paid to one another now and then passed the limits of mere formality.
One of the Parliamentary Lords, the Earl of Pembroke, admitted one day
to Edward Hyde, Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the Lords regretted
having gone so far; he besought the King to have pity on them, and to
free them from the wicked men who now governed everything: if the King
would only accept the conditions proposed to him, as soon as peace was
concluded they would give him back all that he now surrendered, and
make him once more a powerful King.</p>

<p>Counsels of this kind had formerly produced an impression on Charles
I, but this was no longer the case. Concessions made in the hope of
thereby gaining a party had been the occasion of his losing so much:
he had long been convinced that nothing which had once passed into the
hands of the Parliament was ever to be recovered from them<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>.</p>

<p>Some offers of compromise were made by the royal plenipotentiaries.
They would admit the limitation of the bishops’ power by a council of
the lower clergy, and even by laymen, to be elected by this council, in
each diocese: Parliament should regulate the spiritual jurisdiction in
relation for instance to marriage: even a rent-charge on ecclesiastical
revenues for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> ‘the maintenance of peace’ was
suggested. Even this seemed to the King almost too much, and he
declined to go a hair’s-breadth further, as he considered himself bound
by his coronation oath to maintain the Church establishment. Once
more appeared the political argument, that it was necessary for the
power of the crown to retain the dependence upon it of the spiritual
power. The right of the sword also, without which the crown would be
a mere shadow, seemed to be a good ground for a King to fight on.
Charles I agreed to the appointment of a commission for nominating
the commanders, say for three years, but only on condition that
half of it should be named by himself, and that the military power
should hereafter return into his hands. This by no means satisfied
the Parliamentary plenipotentiaries: they asked for the exclusive
nomination of the commission by the two Houses of Parliament, and for
a period of seven years; what was to be done in the future must be
decided at the expiration of the time by parliamentary proceedings, and
in no other fashion<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. They added by way of explanation that the
power of the sword, of peace and war, must always be exercised through
the King and the two Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Two opposite systems were as it were brought into contact. Parliament
desired to subject Church and State to its authority permanently:
the King hoped by momentary concessions to gain the possibility
of restoring in the future the ancient power of the crown: no
agreement was possible. The affairs of Ireland were also discussed at
Uxbridge<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>: but whereas the Parliament demanded the termination
of the existing truce and a renewal of the war, the King sought to
establish permanent peace there.</p>

<p>On the twentieth day of the negotiations (February 22) the meeting
broke up. The Royal plenipotentiaries hastened to reach Oxford that
evening, since their safe conducts expired with that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span>


<h3 id="DISSENSIONS"><i>Dissensions in Parliament. The Self-denying Ordinance.</i></h3>

<p>Nothing would have been more desirable for the two parties who had been
treating together, the Scottish Presbyterians and the Royalists, than
to arrive at an accommodation.</p>

<p>At the time it was often asserted, even by statesmen like Mazarin,
that the Presbyterian principles involved the destruction of the
monarchy, and the introduction into England as well as Scotland of the
republican institutions of the Netherlands<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>. This may however be
contradicted with certainty. The Presbyterians wished to reduce the
crown to an extremely small amount of power, but they had no wish to
abolish it; neither their theory nor their necessities led to this.
The Scots desired to see a King of Scottish extraction on the English
throne, and they wished also that a system of spiritual and temporal
government, such as they had extorted from the King, should be supreme
in England also, if only to prevent the possibility of a reaction from
thence influencing Scotland. They adhered to hereditary monarchy as
a fundamental point: long and bitterly as they had contended against
Charles I, they would not let him be overthrown.</p>

<p>The opinion has often been expressed, that if it was a crime to have
taken up arms against Parliament, no one was guilty of it in a higher
degree than the King himself, and that he had thus disqualified himself
for the throne: and his two sons were liable to the same charge. The
idea was started of offering the crown to the Elector Palatine, who in
that case would more easily recover his own territories, for England
would enter into a league with Spain to counterbalance the French, who
were on the side of the King: or again of raising to the throne the
third son of Charles I, Henry Duke of Gloucester, who was in the hands
of the Parliament, and of bringing him up under the domination of a
perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> Parliament<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>. We find that Henry
Vane, whose ideas went beyond Presbyterianism, betook himself to the
Scottish camp, in order to arrange for one or other of these plans; but
all his efforts were in vain.</p>

<p>No doubt this unbending attitude of the Scots strengthened the
antipathy felt against them on other grounds. It was thought
unendurable that a foreign nation should intrude into the counsels of
England and seek to decide its fate. Their attempt to introduce in
England the Presbyterian system of church government aroused still
greater hostility. The Congregationalists, defeated in the Westminster
Assembly, had no small following among the common people, and a very
extensive one in the army: they most strenuously rejected the hierarchy
which would result from the union of the Presbyterian clergy with the
lay elders, and which would form an ecclesiastical tyranny as bad as
that of the bishops. If things were allowed to run their course, it
must be expected that these tendencies would invade the Lower House,
and perhaps carry it away. Thus it would have been of inestimable value
to the Scots to come to terms with the King, whereby their opponents
would have been at once checkmated: it is strange that they did not
make more effort.</p>

<p>The French ambassador more than once spoke on the subject with the
Scottish commissioners Maitland and Loudon, and urged them to abate
the hardness of the terms offered by them to the King. They required
unconditionally only one concession, his acceptance of the Presbyterian
system: there are necessities in politics which no negotiation can
master. Since the union with England had been formed for the express
purpose of thoroughly destroying Episcopacy in that country, the
Scottish commissioners could not recede on that point. They sought to
induce the ambassador to use his influence to get it admitted: they
assured him that in that case they would moderate every other demand,
that the King should recover his previous authority, and be granted
a larger income, and that as great honour as ever should be paid to
the Queen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> Sabran reminded them that this
depended not so much on their good will as on the English Parliament.
They replied that the resistance of the Lower House to reasonable
things would be advantageous to the King, and hinted that he would
then have the Scots on his side. Unless the King gave way in the
matter of religion, no peace, no result to any negotiations was to be
expected, but if he would concede this a third party would at once be
formed<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>. They reckoned not only on the friends of peace in the
Lower House, but also, and with good reason, chiefly on the nobility
of England, who, as we have seen, felt themselves threatened and
endangered by the line of conduct which seemed to find favour in the
Lower House.</p>

<p>It was also very greatly to the King’s interest to keep down a
party which sought to overthrow him, and openly uttered republican
sentiments. On other points he would have been able to yield, but on
this one he could not. His own convictions were the other way, and
moreover he would have alienated the greater part of his friends. It
was as much a matter of absolute necessity for the King to refuse, as
for the Scots to urge, the concession.</p>

<p>This division contributed further to strengthen the opposite party,
which day by day grew more powerful. At its head was the man of the
age, Oliver Cromwell. He made no secret of his opinion that the future
of England depended neither on the crown nor on the Lords, that a time
would come when there would be neither king nor peers in England. He
charged the Scots with having come to impose their hierarchical system
on the English; but he would himself, he was heard to say, draw the
sword against them, and extort the conditions which were indispensable
for his co-religionists. He would on no account suffer the combination
of aristocrats and Presbyterians, which was being formed, to establish
itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> in power: the mode in which he set to
work is characteristic of his deep, subtle, calculating, and determined
nature, biding its time, but always advancing towards its object.</p>

<p>He first attacked the English nobles: he accused of treason his former
commander, Lord Manchester, who in these complications had exercised
decisive influence. For a long time they had acted together, like the
Independents and Presbyterians in general, Manchester being one of the
leaders of the latter, Cromwell the acknowledged chief of the former;
but now they separated from each other. As the nobles were of opinion
that the King must be allowed to exist, it was attributed to their
want of zeal that Charles I had not been altogether annihilated in the
war. Cromwell accused Manchester of having occasioned the smallness of
the results from the battle of Newbury, by neglecting advantages and
throwing away excellent opportunities; saying that there was reason to
think that Manchester had purposely spared the King and had not wished
to turn the engagement into a complete victory<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>. We have no means
of discovering how far Cromwell was right: Manchester rejoined by a
charge of insubordination. It is obvious that Cromwell’s accusations
fell upon others besides Manchester: the same charge had long ago been
made against Essex and other generals; he only expressed the universal
conviction.</p>

<p>The drift of this quarrel did not escape the Scots. They saw in
Cromwell’s proceedings the intention to seize for himself the chief
command of the army, to dissolve the union of the two kingdoms, and to
destroy the House of Lords. Well might they desire the prayers of the
faithful in their behalf, for the scheme seemed to involve danger to
their religion also.</p>

<p>To rid themselves of this dangerous rival, they once seriously adopted
the idea of impeaching Cromwell. One of the chief charges which had
been urged against Strafford, that namely of destroying the peace
between the two kingdoms, might, it was believed, be brought against
Cromwell: he was an incendiary, that is, a man who kindled strife
between the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> countries<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. The nobles of
the Upper House and the Scots seem to have had an understanding on this
matter. One day the Earl of Essex invited to his house two lawyers,
members of the Lower House, Whitelocke and Maynard, who belonged to the
moderate party; they found there, besides some Parliamentary friends
of Essex, such as Hollis and Stapleton, Loudon, the Chancellor of
Scotland, who formally propounded the question whether an impeachment
on this ground might not be laid against Cromwell. Whitelocke and
Maynard remarked that the case must be well prepared beforehand, and
striking proofs offered, the more so as Cromwell had the greater part
of the Lower House on his side, and friends in the Upper House also.
Hollis was confident of being able to carry the matter through. The
Scots, who at the same time were obliged to consider their national
position, stood aloof from the attempt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cromwell was preparing another and most unexpected blow at
his powerful enemies. He referred to the universal dissatisfaction at
the conduct of the war hitherto, which in spite of their undoubted
superiority had led to nothing decisive: what was gained one day had
been lost again on another; the victories of the summer served as
subjects for evening talk in winter: this was their only advantage, all
this blood had been shed, treasure spent, and land devastated in vain.
All the world cried out against the dissensions and untrustworthiness
of the generals, and complained of the arbitrary conduct of members of
Parliament, even in civil offices.</p>

<p>Relying on this, Cromwell and his friends proposed, at first as usual
through a man of minor importance, that henceforth no member of
Parliament should hold a public office either in the conduct of the war
or in the civil government. The proposal was recommended by the fact
that it wore a religious aspect; it implied an abnegation of all the
advantages which were usually connected with these posts: it appeared a
point of conscience to assent. That some thorough change was necessary
was the universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> opinion, because otherwise it
was thought that the friends of peace in the country would agree to the
proposals made by the King. The matter was so well prepared beforehand,
that the proposition was accepted at the same sitting.</p>

<p>The Scots did not know what to think: they saw that now the contest
between Manchester and Cromwell would be brought to an end once for
all. Some admired the act as a proof of heroism, others saw in it
audacity and danger. It is like a dream, exclaims Baillie; we cannot
yet see the bottom of the affair.</p>

<p>It was at once plain that the Earl of Essex could no longer retain
the command of the army. He had long had to contend against secret
or avowed hostility in the Common Council and in the Lower House: he
ascribed his last disasters in Cornwall to the hostile influence of
his enemies in the Committee, but as yet he had held his ground. Even
now he was not without friends in the Lower House, who proposed that
an exception should be made in favour of the General-in-chief, with
whom Parliament had once sworn to live and die; but they were in the
minority. What could not be done by open attack, Cromwell attained,
says Whitelocke, by a flank movement. Essex was included in a general
ordinance, which every one had to obey.</p>

<p>Still the Upper House refused to accept the bill, on the ground that
it had always been the right of the Lords to shed their blood for the
lawful liberties of the country, and that by the terms of the protest
and their assent to the Covenant they were more than ever pledged to
this: if there were objections against individuals, let them be stated,
and judged in the proper parliamentary fashion; but to exclude all by
a resolution of Parliament was to punish individuals. Three times in
succession they rejected the bill, but they had long ago begun to let
the majority of the Commons lead them along a road which they did not
fully approve; they had not strength for continued resistance.</p>

<p>There was in truth much to be said for the bill. A difficulty which had
elsewhere been found in the conduct of war by a republic, encountered
Parliament as soon as it gained independent power. The spirit of
subordination, which is necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> to military
discipline, did not come naturally to generals and officers who, being
members of Parliament, shared in the possession and exercise of this
power. Personal interests and the opposition of parliamentary factions
had far too much influence on the position and behaviour of them
all<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>.</p>

<p>When the Lords gave way, they still hoped, in the course of the
further discussions on the reconstruction of the army, to prevent its
falling entirely into the hands of the Independents. They added to
the proposals of the Commons a proviso that the officers and soldiers
of the new model should promise to accept the Covenant and the
Presbyterian system of church government. The Lower House however was
not of the same opinion: it was objected, not without reason, that the
church government was not yet fully established, not yet possessed of
legal validity. In respect to the Covenant the Commons would only agree
to a pledge for the officers, not for the privates, on the ground that
this requirement would hinder recruiting. If however this condition
was not passed, it was obvious that the separatist element in the army
must become very powerful; for who from among the non-presbyterian
population would take up arms against the King, except Independents
and other separatists! The Lords had wished to make the nomination of
officers depend on the choice of the two Houses, but this also they
failed to carry: for nothing would so much conduce to the authority of
the general to whom the command should be entrusted as the right of
selecting his own officers.</p>

<p>Unquestionably military considerations contributed very materially to
these resolutions. The soldiers were discontented with their leaders;
even under Waller there had been one mutiny; now and then they talked
of choosing their officers themselves. Moreover their pay had not been
regularly distributed. Thorough and comprehensive arrangements were
now made for this: contributions for this express purpose were exacted
from the counties. If the troops were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> regularly
paid, and kept under strict military discipline, a better result might
be expected from the next campaign.</p>

<p>The Parliament selected as general Thomas Fairfax, who then had won a
great reputation by the victory of Selby and his share in the battle
of Marston Moor, a man whose stately appearance would impress the
troops, pliant in council, but of unbending courage in battle. The
transformation of the army was so thorough that the troops which
were transferred out of the old army were distributed among the new
companies and regiments: the traditions of the old associations were
not to pass over into the new army.</p>

<p>It was still always held that the main question was as to the
acceptance or rejection of the Uxbridge articles; but while the
Royalist and Parliamentary parties were preparing to fight about it,
elements in the latter grew into importance, which at once broke
through their previous arrangements in military matters. Essex and
Manchester, who hitherto had played the chief parts, now retired.
Fairfax and Cromwell, the one with Presbyterian opinions already
growing faint, the other of decidedly separatist and anti-Scottish
views, appeared in the foreground.</p>

<span class="small">THE CAMPAIGN OF 1645.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The King’s whole soul was weary of these painful and fruitless
negotiations: yet even in the parliamentary assembly which he had once
more gathered round him at Oxford, a resumption of them was urged,
and proposals suggested, which seemed to the King base and seditious.
He breathed more freely when this assembly also was dismissed, and
he expressed himself contemptuously about it: he saw with pleasure
Wilmot and Percy, who at that time were labouring for peace, quit his
neighbourhood, and go to France to the Queen’s court<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.</p>

<p>He himself in the course of the discussions had not only strengthened
himself in his own opinion, but came to lean more than ever in the
other direction. He once told his wife, with whom he kept up continual
deliberation as to the best course, that he was now determined, if he
ever again obtained full possession of power, to repeal all penal laws
against the Catholics, that if peace came it would be seen that he was
the true friend of her friends, especially of the bishops, and that
then he would take care, as she repeatedly urged, to get rid of this
everlasting Parliament. It is clear that he meant to be thoroughly
master.</p>

<p>Without being a born soldier or much of a general, Charles I had
developed a taste for the camp. Military successes were the only ones
which he had enjoyed for a long time: his victory over Essex filled
him with a certain self-satisfaction. Always inclined to look on the
favourable side of things, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> reckoned in the
impending campaign on a new series of successes, worthy of the good
cause for which he was fighting. The mysterious ground of his hopes is
worth remarking. He fully believed that hitherto the unjust execution
of the Earl of Strafford had been visited on him, and not only on
him but also on his opponents, who were equally guilty, but that now
the innocent blood shed by them only in the execution of Laud, for
which they were solely responsible, would bring down the wrath of God
upon them<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>,—notions which accurately mark the character of the
religious beliefs which then dominated men’s minds; as though the
secrets of divine things could be brought into such direct connexion
with the complications of human affairs! Charles I lived in the
conviction that he had committed a fault for which he was punished, but
that he was the champion of a holy cause, to which God’s help could
never be wanting: if this did but abide with him half as effectually as
in former years, he would have a successful campaign.</p>

<p>He expected that his Queen would supply him with money and even
with military aid. The state of European affairs was then such that
it seemed possible to gain for the cause of the English crown the
assistance of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who was ready to move in
any direction, and who had gained military experience at the head of an
army gathered by the sound of his name, but free from all territorial
connexions, in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The Queen took
great trouble to induce him to assent, and, what was still more
difficult, to supply him with the means. The King hoped to see him
arrive in one of the ports which he still commanded, if not direct from
France, from the Netherlands by the help of the Prince of Orange<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally the King had resolved to make offers of peace to the Catholic
League, with the security of some temporary concessions; he reckoned on
their acceptance, and also on help from Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span>

<p>In Scotland a powerful reaction was already in progress. Montrose,
who had returned secretly and remained in concealment for a time,
had suddenly raised the King’s banner, as his representative, on the
Grampian Hills. Irish troops, raised in Antrim, came to join him under
Alexander Macdonald, called Colkitto, a man who made a great impression
by his gigantic stature and desperate courage. Montrose formed his own
army chiefly of Highlanders, whom he could not perhaps discipline, but
knew how to manage according to their nature. He conducted the war not
on strategical principles, but by sudden and weighty blows: the onset
of his troops was compared to the rush of a suddenly swollen mountain
stream, so unexpected, stormy, and irresistible was it: wherever he
encountered the Covenanters, he gained the advantage. At the beginning
of April 1645 he took Dundee: he then informed the King<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> that if
he were supported by only 500 cavalry, he would in the course of the
summer bring 20,000 foot-soldiers into England. At the very least
the King might expect that the Scots would be too busy at home to be
very dangerous to him in England. At the time he thought he had not
much to fear from the Parliamentary army. It was the almost universal
expectation that, deprived of its tried officers by the new model, it
would stand trial even less than under Essex. And in fact its first
undertakings had no special result<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>. Though the royal troops
had been compelled to raise the siege of Taunton, yet it had been
immediately renewed. It was assumed that the Parliament would seek at
any cost to save a place so important for the western counties; which
had all the more consequence, because the association uniting Cornwall
and Devonshire was extended over Somerset and Dorset: the four counties
undertook to put a considerable force in the field. At their request
the King let the Prince of Wales, attended by some members of the Privy
Council, take his place among them, while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span>
left his second son, the Duke of York, in Oxford, under the military
tutelage of a trustworthy officer, William Legge, to defend the capital
of Royalist England against eventual attack. According to ancient ideas
the presence of the royal princes was a pledge of redoubled devotion.
The King himself wished to remain free to take up a position in the
midland counties, and advance thence either northwards or eastwards.
He did not expect to conquer the powerful foe, but hoped to occupy him
everywhere, and to succeed in bearing the royal banner victorious in
England as in Scotland, and after a prosperous campaign to enjoy a good
winter.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that he had some grounds for this hope. He relied
mainly on the Celtic elements in the British kingdom, not only in
Scotland and Ireland, but in England also, where they had operated
powerfully, at any rate in Cornwall. Leaning on this support, he called
to his banner the elements of the English commonwealth which were
allied to the monarchy and were threatened along with it. He was their
champion against the tendencies hostile to him and them alike, which
had arisen more powerfully in the British isles than ever in any other
part of the Teutonic world. His hope was to achieve a settlement, in
which the old prerogative of the crown, not without some limitation
of the exclusive domination of Protestantism, should be combined with
parliamentary privileges. Was this unattainable?</p>

<p>I do not know whether he had thought out the question fully. Hitherto
the initiative in government had proceeded from the Crown, which had
enjoyed the preponderance. But through the revolution of 1640 the
dominant power had been transferred to the Parliament, which in most
parts of the kingdom was now recognised: and the Parliament wished to
retain this. The question was, who should henceforth enjoy the supreme
power: and the sword must decide.</p>

<p>The decision came unexpectedly to all parties, suddenly and
irrevocably. The King had saved Chester from an assault by the
Parliamentary troops: without letting himself be delayed over the
trifling enterprises which were suggested to him, he broke up his camp
in May, 1645, his brave nephew Rupert by his side, to execute the plan
before mentioned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> Already at the end of the
month they had an unexpected success: the strong town of Leicester fell
into their hands. A battery planted by the Prince on the right spot
made a breach; but the assault was checked by defences erected behind
it, till the walls were scaled at two weaker points. All resistance
was then in vain, and the town had to expiate by a terrible sack its
Parliamentary leanings.</p>

<p>Scarcely ever has a success been so ruinous to the victorious troops as
this conquest to the King and his army. At once all the energies of his
opponents were directed against him. In London an attack on the eastern
counties was feared, on the possession of which the general security
depended. When at the same time there were rumours of threatened
movements in Kent and of an attack on Dover; the feeling gained ground
that they were on the eve of a catastrophe. The two Houses vied with
each other in taking the necessary precautions. New levies were ordered
in the city and the counties, proclamation of martial law in Kent,
increase of the powers of the generals. The Common Council, not yet
satisfied, requested that orders might be given to the army to advance
immediately, in order to fight with the King, and especially to recover
Leicester before he had fortified it.</p>

<p>Fairfax had not, as was expected, let himself be entangled with the
Parliamentary army in the western counties, but had advanced towards
Oxford, where he obtained, it is true, no successes<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> sufficient to
cause any serious danger, but prevailed so far that the King was most
urgently requested to come to the aid of his most important city, where
the court still was, and especially of the ladies thus endangered, and
above all of his son. He set his army in motion in this direction:
but severe losses had been sustained in the storming of Leicester,
and he was obliged, in the face of a refractory population, to leave
a considerable garrison there: when the army appeared in the field it
was seen to be too weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> to cope with Fairfax.
Charles begged the besieged not to trouble him, for that he would not
let them fall into the enemy’s hands, but he durst not stake all on the
game like a madman. For the present he contented himself with sending
them provisions and a portion of his troops. He himself stayed at
Daventry, to await the return of this detachment, and the arrival of
reinforcements from Devonshire and Wales.</p>

<p>The immediate staff of the King were divided in opinion as to the
plan of the campaign. Prince Rupert would have liked to carry out the
original scheme, and that by moving towards the northern counties. A
considerable portion of the army consisted of horsemen who came from
that quarter, chiefly Cavaliers, who desired nothing so much as to
turn homewards. Rupert was convinced that Fairfax would not look on
quietly, but would follow them, and so Oxford would be freed. On the
other hand Lord Digby had directed his gaze towards Oxford, and held it
to be necessary to go to the aid of the besieged in full strength.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
Undoubtedly Rupert’s opinion was more correct, and more suitable to the
circumstances, especially because it could be executed immediately.
While the King was inclining towards Digby’s view (for was he not
naturally above all things anxious for the liberation of his son?),
and waiting for the reinforcements (as usual with serene temper, with
no apprehensions for the future, and not without devoting himself in
leisure hours to the pleasures of the chase), he gave his enemies time
to come up against him with all their forces.</p>

<p>The troops before Oxford shared the feelings prevalent in London, and
would not linger over a siege while the King was victorious in the
field: and the Parliament readily granted their request. On June 11 we
find Fairfax with his army near Northampton.</p>

<p>Another prayer which could only be granted by Parliament was preferred
by the army. Cromwell, in spite of the Self-denying Ordinance, had been
allowed by a Parliamentary resolution of May 10 to continue temporarily
his military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> functions; the officers now
requested that this man, in whom they had full confidence both
political and military, might be appointed as their general of cavalry.
Naturally the Lords, who had been excluded from the army by the Act,
hesitated about conferring so important a post, in contravention of
it, on their great opponent and rival. But their refusal was for the
moment of no consequence: Cromwell’s temporary commission was to last
for forty days, and it was during this time that on June 13 he entered
Fairfax’s head-quarters, accompanied by some newly-raised squadrons of
cavalry. The council of war was at once held, and Cromwell infused new
fire into its resolutions: the trumpets were immediately blown, and all
the soldiers assembled rejoicing around their leaders.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, at the news that the superior army of the Parliament
was near, the King quitted Daventry—where the division that had
been detached to Oxford had now joined him, but no other aid—to
advance towards the north. But at the first halt, at Harborough, it
was ascertained that the enemy was following close on the heels of
the army, and was now encamped in their immediate neighbourhood. To
encounter him was now absolutely necessary, for how could they possibly
have allowed him to attack their rear while they advanced? In the
council of war the only question was whether to await attack where they
stood, or go in search of the enemy. Rupert was for awaiting attack,
but the King decided the other way.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>It is a popular tradition that the shade of Strafford rose that night
before the King, and warned him against his purpose.</p>

<p>The danger of Charles I lay not in either one course or the other, but
in the whole situation. He was now compelled to do what a few days
before he had declined to do, fight a superior enemy with a weaker
force, and under still more unfavourable conditions. The future of
England was staked on this one cast: the decision of great and vital
questions rested on the issue of an essentially unequal contest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span>

<p>On June 14 the Royal army formed in order of battle a mile from
Harborough. Lord Astley’s infantry formed the centre, Prince Rupert
with about 2000 horsemen the right wing, and Marmaduke Langdale with
the Cavaliers of the north, who however were not altogether on good
terms with him, the left wing. The King placed in reserve his own
bodyguard of horse and a regiment of foot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Parliamentary army was drawn up in rank and file on a
similar rising ground near Naseby, but on the opposite slope, so that
it could not be overlooked from a distance. Cromwell took charge of the
right wing: the left he intrusted to his son-in-law Ireton: Fairfax and
Skippon commanded the battalions of the centre. A reserve, considerable
in proportion, was drawn up in the rear.</p>

<p>Without knowing the position and strength of the enemy, but aware
of his propinquity, the Royal army was seized by its old thirst for
battle, and began its march. Generals and soldiers were unanimous:
any objection, however well founded, would have seemed a proof of
cowardice<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>. Without being checked by slight obstacles, it reached
the opposite hill and was climbing it, when the Parliamentary army
appeared at the top in full order of battle. When the two forces
looked one another in the face at this close proximity, they halted a
moment, as if to take thought, before engaging. The infantry discharged
their pieces once, and then met hand to hand with the sword and
clubbed muskets. It was now shown that the newly-formed troops were
not equal to more experienced ones; the Parliamentary infantry this
time were decidedly worsted; their colours were seen to fall, some
regiments dispersed and fled to Northampton<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. So also the onset
of Rupert’s horsemen once more displayed irresistible strength: in
spite of a skilful and not inefficient ambush of some of the enemy’s
dragoons behind neighbouring hedges, he overthrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1645.</span> Ireton’s regiments, the commander of which was himself wounded
and wellnigh captured. Still the success of the right wing and centre
on this day was not decisive. The Parliamentary reserve could not be
overcome by Rupert, but enabled the defeated horse and foot to rally at
least partially, and the onset of the left wing of the Royal army was
completely repulsed by the Parliamentary right under Cromwell. There
was a moment during the battle when loss and gain were about equal
on each side. Cromwell himself, it is related, was engaged in single
combat with a Royalist general, exchanged blows and shots with him,
and actually lost his helmet: then taking another, which was offered
him, and putting it on the wrong way, defended himself with bravery and
success against his adversary.</p>

<p>It was a battle of the old style, in which fire-arms had scarcely any
effect: they measured their strength man to man, on horseback as well
as on foot. The superiority of the Royalists extended to the infantry,
since they had no longer the old city regiments before them: but the
cavalry, formed from the freeholders of the associated counties,
opposed them with unusual vigour.</p>

<p>When forces are tolerably equal, and not numerous altogether, a
reinforcement to one side, trifling in itself, will usually produce
decisive effect. A splendid regiment of horse that Colonel Rossiter
brought up at the right moment<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>, joined the wing commanded by
Cromwell, who was opposed to the least well-compacted corps of the
Royalists, and had already gained the advantage: when after a short
halt he renewed the attack on Langdale’s division, which he now could
assail on the flank also, he soon mastered it, and drove it before
him in headlong flight. Thereupon Rupert, who had been shamefully
repulsed by the reserve, hastened back, to prevent the King from being
endangered by the change of fortune. At the same moment Ireton was
set free, and could again appear on the battle-field with a portion
of his troops. The defeated Parliamentary infantry that had rallied
again, united with a portion of the cavalry for an attack on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> hitherto victorious Royal battalions. These
defended themselves, like the Spanish infantry at Rocroy about the
same time, according to the expression of a hostile report, ‘with
incredible valour and most steadfastly.’ But being deprived of the
usual protection from their cavalry, and attacked on all sides, both
by horse and foot, these troops saw at last that further resistance
would be their destruction: they could no longer be brought to face
the enemy, but laid down their arms under the condition, which was
very unwillingly granted, that no plundering of individuals should be
allowed<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>.</p>

<p>The King, who had with difficulty been prevented from plunging into the
mêlée, had to abandon the field to the rebels. He re-entered Leicester
in retreat that resembled flight, after immense loss. He had sustained
a most ruinous defeat, his main army was annihilated, the terror of his
arms lost: the Parliamentary army had gained an unequalled victory.</p>

<p>Charles I however was still very far from giving up his cause as lost.
He moved into the counties in which from the first he had found most
support, and which still seemed willing to stand by him. ‘A better
reception,’ he writes from Hereford, ‘I could not have found, if I had
arrived after gaining a victory: I hope soon to replace my losses with
interest’ He believed that a considerable army might still be raised in
Wales, from whence Gerrard met him with a couple of thousand men: the
gentry of South Wales, who assembled at Abergavenny around him, gave
him the best assurances on this head. New preparations began, and the
Marquis of Worcester gave him as hospitable and splendid a reception
in Raglan Castle, as though he were reigning in full authority and
peace. Moreover there was a force in the associated western counties,
which were in full tide of resistance. General Goring had 5000 foot and
4000 horse under his command: every day he hoped to become master of
Taunton, where a Parliamentary garrison still held out.</p>

<p>But the superiority of the Parliamentary army was soon to be exhibited
in these regions also. Victory had completed their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1645.</span> organisation: it gave them self-reliance and confidence in their
leaders<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>. After taking Leicester with its military magazines—a
conquest which the inhabitants regarded as a deliverance—they moved
towards the united western counties. At the passage of Langport, Goring
placed himself in their way: but the Parliamentary army developed such
complete superiority by the bravery of its cavalry and the skilful
use of artillery, that Goring, after one repulse, no longer ventured
to encounter it even with superior numbers. The fortresses which had
been deemed impregnable fell one after the other before the assaults
of Cromwell. By the middle of August the strong places captured or
relieved, Lyme, Sherborne, Langport, Taunton, Bridgewater, formed a
line which virtually cut off Devonshire and Cornwall from the rest of
England. Colonel Poyntz pressed into South Wales and instantly stopped
the attempts to form a new army there.</p>

<p>The dimensions to which the Royalist forces were reduced were
already very small, and their chance of success very slight, when
a misunderstanding took place within the party which utterly
disintegrated it.</p>

<p>It must be reckoned an important event in the King’s life that at
Naseby a part of his papers fell into the hands of the victors. Fairfax
sent them to the Lower House, which communicated them to the Lords and
to the Common Council, and ordered a selection of them to be printed
forthwith<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. These were the original drafts of the letters of
Charles I to his wife, and her answers, and instructions for Uxbridge
and Ireland: some papers seized elsewhere were added to these, together
with a preface and an appendix which declared their authenticity
and commented on their contents. Nothing could have happened more
opportunely for the anti-royalist tendencies. The King’s determination
to give way on neither of the main questions, and his last-formed
purpose of drawing nearer to the Catholics, were brought into the full
light of day. He could now be reproached with offering toleration to
the idolatry of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> Papists, and indemnity to
the blood-stained Irish; of invoking the aid of foreign powers and
princes for the destruction of English liberties and of Protestantism.
The publication of course produced a great impression even on the
King’s own friends. They saw now that the King, in opposition to his
own Oxford Parliament, had preferred war to the continuance of the
negotiations. At the very moment when arms offered no further hope
this double disagreement broke out. The conviction everywhere gained
ground that the King must submit further and more irrevocably than
he seemed inclined to do. A negotiation was entered into between the
members of the Privy Council in attendance on the Prince of Wales and
the peacefully-inclined members of Parliament, arising out of the wish
of both to help one another to a compromise. In the same direction went
the views of the leading men in the united western counties, which
were at the time of great weight from the independent character of the
movement there.</p>

<p>This was exactly the constitutional standpoint which the Clubmen,
who just then suddenly appeared in various places, sought to attain.
They were the inhabitants of the counties who declined any longer to
allow themselves to be violently treated and plundered, first by one
party and then by the other. Assembling at their own will, with any
weapons that came to hand, even clubs, from which they got their name,
with the intention merely of resisting at every point where defence
was possible the violence of the soldiery, they at once proceeded to
a general manifesto: they most urgently demanded a truce between the
King and the Parliament, and a renewal of the peace negotiations, for
which purpose they would send delegates to both sides. They opposed the
Royalist soldiery as well as the Parliamentarians, but on the whole
were of moderate Royalist opinions. Fairfax treated them as enemies,
but Prince Rupert entered into alliance with them: for the Prince was
now himself inclined to a compromise. From Bristol, where he had taken
the command, he sent word to the King that for the rescue of his crown,
his posterity, and the nobility of the country, there was nothing left
but to make a treaty: he urged that it would be better to save part
than to lose the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span>

<p>King Charles I was at this moment as fully aware as any one else of
the desperate state of his circumstances: at the beginning of August
he arranged that, if danger pressed, his son should fly to France, for
it was now necessary to prepare for the worst. For himself he adhered
to his resolution not to give way a foot’s breadth. His was a nature
which is not bent but steeled by adversity. At this time he wrote to
his secretary in calm but strong language, that with God’s help he
would never either abandon the Church to another form of government,
or rob the crown of the authority which his ancestors had transmitted
to him, or forsake his friends<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. To Prince Rupert he replied that,
as for his advice, as soldier and statesman he might perhaps approve
it, as Christian he must reject it; whatever afflictions God might
ever visit him with, he durst not abandon a cause which was that of
God. He believes that in the end it will triumph, but for himself he
has no such hope: all that is left him is to die with honour and a
good conscience. In fact, he dares not reckon on success, but only
on this, that God will hereafter avenge his cause. To those who will
stand by him he must say that they have nothing to expect except death
for the good cause, or a life made miserable by the oppression of the
rebels<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>. His words imply the consciousness of a duty independent
of accidental circumstances, transcending the complications of the
moment, of great importance for the future of England, and highminded
in themselves, if a prince can be called highminded, who, conscious of
impending ruin, shows himself determined not to yield a hair’s-breadth.
But they were not calculated to hold together or to strengthen his
party: they died away without effect. To offer men ruin and endless
troubles as the reward of their devotion is not the way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1645.</span> win them. Who would join the King’s cause with any pleasure
when he himself treated it as lost? Men saw in his expressions only one
proof more of his invincible obstinacy.</p>

<p>When Prince Rupert came to England to fight for his uncle, he had
also the idea of gaining a princely establishment for himself: to
expose himself to ruin for the English Church was not at all in his
mind. He had already been put out of humour by the King’s rejection
of his proposal, when he received from the Parliamentary army that
was besieging him in Bristol, after he had made one or two fruitless
sorties, a summons which in form was well calculated to make an
impression upon him. It was at the same time a warning, reminding him
that the Parliamentary party against which he was in arms, was the
very one which had always sought to help the Palatine family, and had
expended blood and money for it; that he need not think the crown was
at stake, for that would remain where it must be, but that the contest
now was merely between the Parliament, the King’s great council, and
his actual evil advisers; that the party which he was now defending
was the one which had always opposed the interests of his family. They
referred to Digby, who had quarrelled with the Prince at Naseby, and
had since kindled the flame of contention all the more eagerly because
he thus kept away the King, who cherished the design of going with
the Prince to Bristol, from fear of there losing all his influence.
If Rupert now gave ear to the summons, there were military reasons to
justify him, for one of the protecting forts had fallen already into
the enemy’s hands: but still there is no doubt that political motives
co-operated. It had been thought that he would fight to the death: he
had promised to hold Bristol three months: that he should surrender in
the third week, before any extreme necessity arose, excited general
astonishment, and caused the most painful emotion in the King, who was
just preparing to attempt a relief with a small flying force which he
had assembled and some help which he expected from Goring. He thought
he perceived that Rupert was guided by counsellors of corrupt heart. If
his own relations treated him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> thus, what was he
to expect from strangers? Of all the calamities with which he had been
visited, none, he said, had grieved him more deeply.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Digby, who seized the favourable moment
for ruining his rival entirely—for even after the loss of power
jealousy is wont to linger in princely courts—Prince Rupert was
declared to be deprived of the high military authority he enjoyed,
and of all his offices: his passports were also sent him with the
insulting explanation that henceforth he might seek his subsistence
on the Continent. The Prince received his dismissal under the
counter-signature of Lord Digby, whom he regarded as the author of his
disgrace and his mortal enemy. At the same time his best friend and
political and military associate, William Legge, was removed from his
government at Oxford. The fall of Bristol was the moment at which the
party of the statesmen about the King obtained the upper hand of the
military men. The soldiers were not minded to submit: professional
feeling was aroused, and most of them made the Prince’s cause their own.</p>

<p>But apart from this, just as the capture of Bristol had once been a
decisive advantage, so now the loss of that place with all its stores
was an indescribable misfortune. Even in the most devoted provinces,
for instance in Wales, the opponents of the King at once appeared in
strength.</p>

<p>Charles I was a prey to the most painful hesitation: his purposes
vacillated between opposite possibilities. At one time it seemed to him
advisable to retire to Anglesey, which could be defended during the
winter, or, if necessary, still further to the Isle of Man, finally
to Ireland: only it seemed to him dishonourable for a king to make
his escape in this wise. Then the events in Scotland, where Montrose
had won a great victory, invited him thither. Montrose, on his march
towards the English frontier, found himself threatened at once by the
Parliamentary army which was following him, and by the neighbouring
lords who raised their districts against him. Without much hesitation
he threw himself on the army, though perhaps a third stronger than his
force, and supported mainly by the brave old Lord Airly (who was more
than eighty years old when he took part in the battle),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1645.</span> and by another Ogilvy who had learned war under Gustavus
Adolphus, he completely routed them (at Kilsyth, August 15). Thereupon
Glasgow fell into his hands; Edinburgh begged for mercy: he appeared
as master in that country. Under the influence of these tidings, and
being pressed on all sides, the King determined<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> to cut his way
through to the army which bore his standard victorious in the field.
He wished to try the way to Scotland past Chester through Lancashire
and Cumberland. He arrived at Chester at the right time to prevent the
capture of the place; but in the open field his troops could not be
induced to face the enemy: from the ramparts he witnessed their defeat.
Not without a hope of opening himself a way through Yorkshire, he
betook himself to Newark, the least endangered of the places he still
held. Meanwhile Montrose had been defeated: he in his turn could not
withstand the regular troops which David Lesley brought against him
from England, and at Philiphaugh, near the border, he was surprised and
beaten. The King knew this well, but at the rumour that Montrose had
again gained an advantage, he once more resolved to make the attempt.
After some days’ march he ascertained that the news was false, and
that Montrose had fled to the Highlands. Digby could not be dissuaded
from proceeding with part of the troops, less in the hope of achieving
anything (for his friends had already been dispersed), than to avoid
returning to Newark. The King returned there alone with the rest of his
forces.</p>

<p>He had terrible scenes to endure there among his own immediate
following. Digby had departed because he would not meet Prince
Rupert<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>, who, though he did not refuse to quit England, wished
first to clear his military honour and justify himself in the King’s
eyes. He asked to be brought before a court-martial, which acquitted
him of all the slanderous charges brought against him on account of
his conduct at Bristol. In the same degree in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1645.</span> soldiers by profession showed their sympathy with the
Prince, they exhibited also their indignation against Digby, by whose
attacks they felt their military honour injured. The fact that at this
very time Willis, the Governor of Newark, one of the Prince’s warmest
supporters, was removed from his post, seemed to them to prove that the
King would always be governed by Digby’s advice: and their displeasure
was fanned into flame. Rupert, Willis, and Gerrard so completely lost
sight of their respect for the prince for whose authority they had
hitherto fought, that they forced their way into his presence to make,
we cannot say representations, but accusations against him. With his
arms akimbo, displeasure in every feature, Rupert strode close up to
the King, who was sitting at his supper. The King rose and retired into
a window with the three generals to ascertain their business. Willis
complained of the dishonour done him by publishing his dismissal, and
demanded public satisfaction. Rupert observed that Willis was unjustly
treated for being his friend. Gerrard attacked Digby, by whom he had
been removed from his command in Wales: both he and the two others
pointed to Digby as the author of all disorders: they declared that
it was not the King who governed, but Digby through him. The King
asked whether a rebel could say anything worse; and in fact it was the
severest accusation that had been brought against him for five years.
Nephew, said the King, this is a matter of serious import. Rupert
referred to the events at Bristol, in consequence of which he had been
subjected to false accusations. Nephew, said the King: he would have
said more, but the words died on his lips. The Prince gave no sign of
respect: with his arms akimbo, as he had entered, so he quitted the
King’s presence<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>.</p>

<p>All the sources of help on which the King had reckoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1645.</span> in the spring now failed him. A treaty with the Irish
Catholics was concluded through an emissary, originally instructed to
refer to the Viceroy, but subsequently intrusted with full powers, upon
conditions which could not be openly avowed—one of the stratagems of
Charles I, which drove to despair his ministers who knew nothing about
it, and were ruinous to himself<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>. The document fell into the hands
of the London Committee: instead of benefiting the King, the treaty
served thoroughly to prejudice the English nation against him.</p>

<p>The French were so fully occupied with the war in Germany, the Duke of
Lorraine with the attempt to recover his hereditary dominions, that
they could give the King no help. If Charles had thought of cutting his
way into Scotland, it was merely because he saw no safety in England.
At this moment too, the quarrels which had long disturbed his court
broke out violently: the authority exercised by a minister who was
no longer with him, was made a personal charge against himself: the
boldest champions of his cause abandoned it. He was fortunate in being
able to return with a small company to Oxford, where for the moment he
gathered a kind of court about him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Parliamentary army had thoroughly mastered the Clubmen.
In every province a decree of Parliament was published, which declared
it treason for an armed body of men to assemble anywhere without
permission.</p>

<p>There was no longer anything to oppose the army, which was everywhere
victorious, except the armed force of Devonshire and Cornwall. But
quarrels similar to that between Digby and Rupert had broken out
between the Privy Council which surrounded the Prince of Wales, and
the military commanders. General Goring, who loved to relieve his
military duties with drinking bouts and play, wanted to be virtually
independent in the conduct of the war, and especially to take no orders
from the Prince’s counsellors. He had already obtained from the King
instructions to the Privy Council to let him, as the general, take
part in their deliberations: when this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> not
done, Goring imputed every disaster that happened to the members of the
council. In view of the growing strength of the enemy, he desired to
be subordinate to the Prince only, and sought to confine within narrow
limits the influence of civil officers over the army; no officer’s
commission should be signed without his knowledge, no movement of the
army ordered without the officers’ concurrence. This not being granted
he formed the rash resolve—for steadiness and perseverance were, not
the qualities for which he was distinguished—of abandoning the cause
he served and retiring to France. The same spirit was displayed also
in the militia. No one among the natives was so active and conspicuous
as Richard Grenville, High Sheriff of Devon, who levied troops on his
own account, and imposed contributions which he expended for their
support. In consequence of his independent action he also quarrelled
with the government; at times the troops raised by him refused to obey
the generals appointed in the King’s name. How was an energetic and
orderly conduct of the war to be thought of? It came at last to this,
that Grenville was imprisoned by the Privy Council.</p>

<p>If the most general reason for the King’s disasters be sought, it will
be found in this hostility between the holders of civil and military
power. He himself could not master it, far less could the Prince of
Wales be expected to do so: whereas on the side of the Parliament the
military tendencies were entirely supreme, and carried away with them
all energies of another kind; no other will could oppose them.</p>

<p>There was still a general of reputation and talent, Lord Hopton, who
undertook the control of the army in concert with the Privy Councillors
who formed the Prince’s government: but, as he said, he did it only
from a sense of duty, for no honour was to be gained. On his banner
were inscribed the words ‘I will strive my King to serve’: he would
obey, he said, even at the risk of his good name. Under his command the
forces of the western counties once more measured their strength with
the Parliamentarians, at the well-fortified pass of Torrington, and
here offered some resistance; but the superiority of the Parliamentary
foot over the Royalists was so decisive that the latter did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> hold their ground very courageously. At the end
of February Fairfax advanced into Cornwall. On March 2 the Prince, no
longer safe in Pendennis, where he had been staying, embarked with
his counsellors in a vessel which took them to the Scilly Islands.
A considerable body of horsemen was still united under Hopton. But
already every man was possessed by a conviction that all they did was
in vain. The service was very carelessly performed. In a council of war
the officers declared to the general that their men could no longer be
brought to face the enemy: they told him frankly that unless he began
negotiations they should proceed to do so without him. The troops
themselves actually began: at the first encounter of the advanced
guards in the neighbourhood of Probus, the Royalists cried out ‘Truce,
truce!’ they entered upon it before it was concluded<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>. After brief
conferences a capitulation was arranged (March 14) in accordance with
which Hopton’s brigades,—there were nine of them,—were disbanded one
after the other. The King’s cavalry had to surrender their arms at the
very place where formerly Essex’s foot had done the same<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>. Most of
the troops declared themselves ready to go to Ireland and fight there
for the Parliament, without paying any attention to the counter-orders
of the King. The superiority of the Parliamentary army was combined
with a sort of voluntary disbanding of the Royalist forces. The forts
and castles which were still in their hands went over one by one.</p>

<p>At the beginning of April even Exeter capitulated: the Parliamentary
army advanced towards Oxford, where there seemed nothing left for the
King but to surrender. The war was virtually over. The attempt of
Charles I to wrest back by force of arms from the Parliament the power
which it had acquired had broken down.</p>

<p>This conclusion was exactly contrary to the results of the analogous
undertaking of Henry IV in France. Henry IV had conquered the capital
and the country, set aside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> Estates, and
laid the foundations for that royal power on which it was possible to
raise the proudest monarchy of modern times. In England the forces
which the King and his adherents could command were defeated in the
country and crushed; the supreme authority was in the hands of the
Parliament, with which the capital had hitherto been always in perfect
accord.</p>

<br><span class="small">INDEPENDENTS AND PRESBYTERIANS. FATE OF THE KING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If the war between the King and Parliament could be regarded as at
an end, the controversy between them was by no means concluded. The
King in spite of his defeat maintained the position which he had taken
up on quitting London; he was as firm in it as ever. So far as the
pacification of the country depended on an understanding of the King
with Parliament, not a step had been gained; the questions had rather
grown more complicated through the course of events. The people, crying
for peace, would undoubtedly have been contented with the restoration
of a Parliamentary régime without the abasement of the royal power.
But in the tumult of violence and faction how could moderate wishes
have had any chance even of full expression, to say nothing of being
carried out? The men who gave the tone to the Lower House required of
the crown a sort of renunciation of the military authority, which was
opposed to the ancient notions of the monarchy. They deemed themselves
compelled for their own sakes to persist. But it was not the strength
of Parliament alone which had prevailed over the King. The great change
to his disadvantage had been wrought by the Scots, the last blow in the
field and his ruin by the Independents: and these victorious allies
had their own objects and sought to gain them. The Scots desired the
uprooting of the episcopal system; their last alliance with England was
founded on the assent to this demand. The Independents meditated new
forms in both Church and State. They vehemently opposed the Scottish
system, and sought to alienate Parliament from it, and bring it over to
their own ideas.</p>

<p>How the cause of the King and his fate should be decided was an element
in the intestine strife between the parties: it depended mainly on
whether the Presbyterians or the Independents gained the upper hand.</p>

<span class="small">FLIGHT OF THE KING TO THE SCOTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the realm of those ideas, which constitute the western world by
their connexion and shake it by their strife, the Independents exhibit
views in relation to both religious and political government which,
if not entirely new, yet acquired general influence first through
them. Religion by its nature aims at a world-embracing community of
doctrine and life—an idea on which all great hierarchies are founded,
including the Papacy. As the Reformation movement arose chiefly from
the oppression which the carrying out of religious unity in a stringent
form exerted over single kingdoms and states, it led directly to
national unions,—national churches, which no doubt were founded on a
creed that claimed universal acceptation, but whose authority could
never extend beyond mere provincial limits. Among the formations of
this kind the two most strongly organised are doubtless those which
were established in Great Britain. We know to what far-reaching
contests their opposition led, shaking not merely men’s minds, but the
very government of the two countries.</p>

<p>The Independents appeared on the frontiers of the Anglican and Scottish
Presbyterian Churches just at the outbreak of their quarrel. The
faithful, who when oppressed by Laud at first fled before him to the
Continent or emigrated to America, now held together in congregations,
which through the closer spiritual union of their members satisfied
their need of common religious feeling. Something similar took
place in Ireland, in the colonies planted there by the Scots, when
Stafford tried to subject them to the yoke of Canterbury. But the
Congregationalists who then returned to Scotland did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1645.</span> again join the national Presbyterian Church. They assisted
gladly and efficiently in defeating the power of the bishops—first
in Scotland and then in England, where they united with all the other
separatists who had been held down by Laud, but never crushed: but
at all times they persisted in trying to carry out their own views.
They not only opposed on principle the influence of the State over the
Church, but rejected the national as well as the universal, hierarchy,
the General Assembly of the Scots as well as the English Convocation.
They admitted only a brotherly influence of the churches over each
other, consistent with co-ordinate authority: the right to decide for
the community they would acknowledge only in the assembled congregation
itself. In their system the difference between clergy and laity
vanished entirely, for they had no objection to laymen preaching.</p>

<p>As they had taken part in the great war against the bishops on the
assumption that after victory they would be free from all religious
oppression, and had contributed perhaps the most powerfully of all
to the decision by their influence over the city populations, they
regarded it as a hateful injustice that the Presbyterians refused them
toleration. The last act of union was in a certain sense a declaration
of war against the Independents, who in consequence took no share in
the Assembly of Divines.</p>

<p>With these ecclesiastical efforts were connected tendencies both
intellectual and political, allied to them by internal analogy. The
most important and most complete expression of them we find in Milton.
Without having himself had any direct share in the religious changes,
Milton advocated the rights of the human spirit in its individual
character. He attacked the censorship of the press, which the
Presbyterians most strictly exercised, in a pamphlet<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> which must
be ranked as high in the literature of pamphlets as any of Luther’s
popular writings, or the Provincial Letters of Pascal. It must be
reckoned as the most eloquent and powerful of all pleas for the liberty
of the press: the natural claim of the truth-seeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1645.</span> spirit to unchecked utterance is fully recognised in it. Milton
is all the more urgent on the subject because he sees his own people
inspired with an energy which presses forwards in all directions and
is striking out new paths. She sees the light, says he; waking up from
sleep she shakes her locks filled with the strength of Samson. And this
is the moment at which men would oppress her with old restrictions, and
invoke against her the power of the State: as though it were possible
in great convulsions to escape a confused variety of new opinions—as
though it were not the worst of all opinions to refuse to hear anything
but what is pleasing. And they dare to denounce as heretics men who for
their lives and faith, for their learning and pure intents, merit the
very highest esteem.</p>

<p>In similar contrast, and in fact on the basis of the principle already
adopted, appeared also political views of the widest scope. It was
declared a crying inconsistency that the Scots, after denouncing their
King from the pulpit and taking up arms against him, should still
acknowledge him and seek to restore his power. Milton would not hear
of the combination of national sovereignty with divine right, which
formed the basis of the Scottish system, and which floated also before
the eyes of the Presbyterians in England. If the crown were of divine
right, no treaty with it would be possible, for in that case the entire
power of the State would belong to the King. But men are born free,
they are the image of God: authority is conferred on one for the sake
of order, but the prince is not only not the lord of the rest, he is
their deputy: the magistrate is above the people, but the law is above
the magistrate. Milton did not hesitate to maintain that the victory
won over the King in the struggle necessarily led to his fall, to a
change of government and of the laws.</p>

<p>With these views coincided the theories expressed by Henry Vane, who
was then perhaps the most conspicuous leader in parliamentary affairs.
He admitted that the supreme power was of divine right, and obedience
to it an indispensable duty; but it depended on the people whether or
not they would commit it to an individual, and on what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1645.</span> conditions<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>. Since now the King had transgressed the
conditions imposed on him, and had been conquered in the war which
broke out in consequence, the people was in no way bound to revert
to the old form of government, but entered on the possession of its
original freedom: for the same end for which the old government had
been established they might now abolish it, according to the idea of
justice which was originally implanted in man, and is interwoven with
his being. The republic was not yet directly pointed out as the ideal
form of government, but the right was claimed of resorting to it at
pleasure.</p>

<p>Never did these ideas find ground better prepared to receive them,
or more ready acceptance, than in the army, which from the first had
been formed on corresponding principles. In the time of Manchester,
who allowed it from forbearance, the separatists who desired to take
military service gathered by preference round Cromwell, whose object it
was to lead into the field men of decided opinions<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>. His soldiers
should be as incapable of looking behind them as himself,—he actually
made it an accusation against the Lords that they were too prudent.
These views were now confirmed by success. The Independents and other
separatists had done the best work in the open field, as in the city
disturbances. They laughed at the Scots and their moderation, which
they held to be mere hypocrisy, a mask from behind which to bring
England under their sway. For if it was allowable to make war against
the King, it was lawful to overthrow him, to imprison and put him to
death. How astonished were the Presbyterian preachers who followed
Cromwell’s camp at the anti-royalist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> and
destructive spirit which prevailed in it<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>. Charles I was regarded
merely as the successor of William the Conqueror, who had made his
generals into lords, and his captains into knights, the ancestors of
the nobility and gentry still subsisting: but all this had been founded
on the right of the sword, and might again be reversed by the same
right. They felt like successors of the Anglo-Saxon population, again
after long oppression regaining the upper hand. Theoretically and
historically they considered themselves justified in overturning the
existing State and founding a new one.</p>

<p>We may observe the stages of the intentions which in this contest
were successively exhibited. At first it was only intended to restore
the full efficiency of the Parliamentary régime: the elections in the
autumn of 1640 were held with this in view. But the Parliament when
it assembled raised claims which would have given it unconditional
preponderance, a kind of political and military omnipotence. The Scots
and the Parliamentary leaders in concert with them added the demand
for the subjection of the King to a Presbyterian system. As a fourth
step, the Independents rejected this form also, and entirely disowned
obedience to the King.</p>

<p>Nor were these in any sense empty theories: the Independents had
actually gained a power which was only limited by the power of their
opponents, who were the King’s enemies also. It is asserted that
on the publication of the King’s letters captured at Naseby, which
were read everywhere throughout the country, they intended to induce
the people to demand his deposition, and upon this, it was further
planned to declare Charles I unfit to reign, and to make the Earl of
Northumberland, whom they hoped to carry with them, Protector of the
realm: in this way they would have given a new form to the kingdom<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.</p>

<p>They could not however reckon on the assent of the English people.
In the counties Episcopalian sympathies prevailed: in the capital
Presbyterian opinions, in direct opposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> to
the Independents, were generally accepted. For while the extravagances
into which the sects fell, appearing in various forms one after
the other, necessarily offended those who did not belong to them,
the Presbyterian preachers, after it came to an open breach in the
Assembly, distinctly attacked the Independents from the pulpit; and
they were still by far the more powerful. The common people, sure
of their faith, desired the Presbyterian forms, stringent church
discipline, even excommunication, and rejected toleration. The
elections to the Common Council had hitherto been conducted on an
understanding between the Presbyterians and the separatists, but at the
end of the year 1645 Presbyterianism was dominant and the sectarians
were excluded. In January 1646 a fast day was held in the city, at
which the Covenant was renewed with signature and oath. The next
day the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council presented a petition to
Parliament for the carrying out of church government in the Scottish
fashion, conformably to the Covenant.</p>

<p>In Parliament these views were not predominant, as may be inferred
from the fact that Henry Martin (who had been the first to express
decidedly anti-royalist sentiments—he had said that it was better
for one family to perish than many—and had in consequence been
driven from Parliament) in January 1646 ventured to return thither.
But there was still a considerable Presbyterian party in the Lower
House, which had been not a little strengthened by the result of the
supplementary elections held in the autumn of 1645<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>. In the Upper
House the Lords, who saw themselves slighted by the transformation of
the army, were inclined the same way: both foresaw their own ruin if
the Independents became entirely masters. Still they calculated on
being able to withstand them: they had on their side the words of the
treaties, and the interests of the Scots, against whom the Independents
were specially hostile. The Scots greeted the manifestation in the city
with indescribable satisfaction: the Scottish Parliament entered into
direct communication with it; for the English Parliament, it was said,
notoriously can do nothing without the capital.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span>
One of the Scottish clergy exclaimed, that after God he relied most on
the capital of England.</p>

<p>But while a numerous party in Parliament, the city, and the Scots were
united against the Independents, who on their side were equally well
represented in Parliament, and controlled the army, men’s eyes turned
back to the King in a new fashion. Although without any practical
power, the King could still, through the authority of his name, which
operated as a seal of legality, throw into the scale a considerable
weight in favour of the party which he supported.</p>

<p>But how, it will be asked, could he possibly think of drawing nearer
to the Independent party, which was as anti-royalist as it could
be? A letter sent from Oxford to Henry Vane in March 1646, with the
King’s knowledge, to a certain extent explains this<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>. It sought
to convince him that he would gain nothing by totally overthrowing
the King: the sole result would be the ruin of England at home and
abroad. The King wished at that time to come to London, in order to
deal in person with the Parliament. After his appeal to arms had
failed, he thought that he should be able to return to much the
same relations as had subsisted before he quitted Whitehall in the
beginning of 1642. The most difficult point of the negotiations to be
expected obviously lay in the Covenanting demands of the Presbyterians
in league with Scotland; and in order to have any support against
them, the King needed the aid of the Independents. He appears to have
believed that their chief object was to obtain religious independence
for their congregations; and this should be for ever assured through
his authority; in alliance with them he would establish freedom of
conscience for them and for himself<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>. And though they had once
formed a league with the Presbyterians against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1646.</span> Episcopalian system, they now seemed not averse to enter into
a similar one with the King against the Presbyterians. There were
Independent influences at work about the King and even about the Queen.
With the latter they were furthered chiefly by Percy, brother of the
Earl of Northumberland. The Scots and Presbyterians were so much
alarmed that they claimed the influence of the French government with
the Queen on their behalf.</p>

<p>We return to the dealings of the French government with English
affairs. The troubles in England had been of indescribable advantage
to France, by allowing her free scope on the Continent: during this
period the French in alliance with Sweden had done serious mischief
to the strength of the house of Austria in Germany, and through the
risings in Portugal and Catalonia, to the Spanish monarchy also: their
power at this moment girdled the world. After long hesitation, and as
a last resource against utter destruction, Charles I and his consort
offered to the French court an offensive and defensive alliance; and
Mazarin, who now governed the Regent in relation to foreign affairs
as completely as ever Richelieu had done, was inclined to assent: but
he would not take part with Charles I in his domestic affairs; he had
recalled one of the plenipotentiaries sent to England, Grecy, because
he had connected himself too closely with the King, and awakened
mistrust of France in Parliament. When he sent over Sabran, with whom
we are acquainted, in the spring of 1644, he instructed him before
making any further league with the King to bring about a reconciliation
between him and the Parliament, on the supposition that the equilibrium
between the two, on which the due observance of the laws depended,
would thus be maintained. He was to support the just claims of Charles
I, but was not to help to make him monarch and lord of England<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.</p>

<p>Charles I had never any sympathy with Spain: the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1645.</span> of Braganza, under which Portugal was separated from the
Spanish monarchy, found support from him, and sought, like the house
of Orange, to obtain through him a dynastic alliance: the Portuguese
ambassador managed his correspondence with his wife. Still it appeared
to the French that in the struggle between France and Spain he leant
rather to the Spanish side: they mistrusted the presence in his council
of Bristol and Digby, who had long been known as representatives of
the Spanish interest. All the less were they disposed to contribute to
the full restoration of his power, so as to enable him possibly in the
future to be troublesome to them.</p>

<p>It is obvious that Sabran, who acted according to these instructions,
could effect but little. Apart from the practical difficulties—for a
full recognition of Parliament must have preceded any negotiation—he
could not win the confidence of either party. Charles I observed with
astonishment that the ambassador, from whom he expected the most active
support to his cause, and an unequivocal declaration in his favour,
assumed the attitude of a neutral<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>: he requested the Queen to apply
in France for his recall. On the other side, Parliament thought that
Sabran encouraged the King in his resistance, which was actually true
at least in relation to the religious question. Sabran was commissioned
also to deal with the Scots; he was to warn them against too close a
connexion with England, since they would in that way gradually become a
province of the neighbouring country, and endanger their old alliance
with France. The Scots replied that their view rather was to strengthen
that alliance, and by means of their union with England to bring that
kingdom also to join it: if an understanding between the King and the
two Parliaments could be achieved, he would himself announce this
alliance. They suggested the prospect that they themselves, on the
strength of their old treaties, and the English with them, in agreement
with France, would take part in the war in Germany, primarily for the
recovery of the Palatinate—an undertaking which could not fail to gain
them a great body of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1645.</span> allies in Germany<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>. It
is plain that this implied no opposition to the French schemes, but is
rather a development of them. The Scots assumed that they would retain
the upper hand in England. The connexion between France and Scotland
seemed to both parties equally desirable.</p>

<p>The rise of the Independents contributed to the same result. The French
government was horrified at the idea of their obtaining the superiority
and changing England into a republic. Such a state would be mightier
than the strongest kingdom: for as in republics all contribute to the
common resolutions, so every one strives his utmost to carry them
out. And if then the English republic should unite with that of the
Netherlands, they would form a power quite irresistible, especially at
sea<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. Moreover so successful a rebellion would afford a bad example
to other countries, and might easily lead them to imitate it. They
durst not let them attain their end.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1645 we find Montereuil in London, resuming all the
connexions which Bellièvre had formed, and he himself had extended: he
renewed the closest intercourse with Lord Holland. Holland remarked
that the King had entered into a kind of correspondence with the
Independents, as believing that their views could never be carried
out, and that friendly relations with them would be useful against the
Presbyterians; but how much better would it have been for him to come
to an agreement with the latter. For the views of the Independents
pointed to complete equality in both Church and State: it was their
purpose to destroy the very name of King of England: while it was the
wish of the Scots, and of the better part of the English, to save the
royal authority, only under limitations which were certainly hard, but
were based on the old laws. He thought that it could not go against the
King’s conscience to acknowledge the Presbyterian form of church, which
approached far more nearly than did that of the Independents to the
episcopal form, inasmuch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> as it made some church
control and subordination possible. He requested that the influence
of France might be used to bring the King round to an understanding
with the Scots and Presbyterians: moreover he himself hoped thereby to
regain the favour of the King and Queen. Montereuil said that he had
instructions to assure him that his leading would be followed in this
respect, and that by bringing about such an understanding he would earn
immortal fame, and in the future be the first man in England<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>.</p>

<p>It was actually to Holland that the idea first occurred that the King
should retire to the Scottish army: so long as the King in any way
kept the field, he had thought of other expedients; but when Bristol
surrendered, and that defeat had been sustained near Chester, he saw
no other means of resisting the Independents save by throwing the King
into the arms of the Scots<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>. There he would find support enough to
compel the Independents to accept endurable terms.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this fully suited the French policy. It seemed
the best means of bringing about that connexion between the English
Presbyterians, the Scots, and the King, by which not only the supremacy
of the Independents might be hindered, but also grand prospects might
be opened for the domination of France in Europe. A negotiation was
begun, which by the manner in which it succeeded, and yet at the same
time did not succeed, exercised an important influence over subsequent
events.</p>

<p>The French above all things desired to get security from the Scots
that they would grant the King endurable terms if he acceded to the
proposal. They informed Loudon and Balmerino, the commissioners then
in London, that otherwise it might be more advantageous for the King
to deal with the Independents than with them and the Presbyterians.
They tried to show that the future independence of Scotland depended on
this combination. Loudon said that he could not undertake to make any
alteration in the articles agreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> on between
the two Parliaments, but gave them to understand that concessions would
be made to the King’s wishes on points not irrevocably settled; thus
in military affairs they would accept the proposals made by him at
Uxbridge; in relation to Ireland they would allow new deliberations in
regular parliamentary course; they would spare Digby, whom they would
even seek to gain, and other enemies of Parliament in the King’s suite:
he made himself answerable for carrying these things in Scotland. He
was asked whether and how he expected to bring the Independents to
accept these conditions: he answered that he would demand it by reason
of the treaties subsisting between the two kingdoms, and should they
refuse, he would compel them by force<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>.</p>

<p>There were schemes on foot not merely for saving the King, but for
the formation of a widespread combination for the repression of the
Independents, when Montereuil, by instruction of his court, and in
concert with the Presbyterians, went to Oxford to induce the King
to take refuge in the Scottish camp. It was just at the moment when
the last Royalist corps in Cornwall surrendered and was dispersed.
Montereuil represented to the King that especially after the last
demonstrations of the city of London he could retain no hope of
preventing the introduction of the Presbyterian system: it was
virtually established, and was an evil that the King must put up with,
since some good might be derived from it. It is certain that the King
had given up the hope of achieving anything permanent: he even promised
to give full satisfaction on this point, the only one on which it had
to be given, provided they would require of him nothing that went
against his conscience<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>. He had always thought of coming himself to
London for the negotiations: that being shown to be impracticable, he
now promised to betake himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> to the Scottish
camp, it being assumed that there his conscience and his honour would
be respected, and his attendants safe. It was not his own idea, but he
accepted it, as seeming to offer him an endurable solution. He declared
that he was ready to let himself be instructed in the Presbyterian
system, and in general to satisfy the Scots in that matter, so far
as a corresponding promise was made to him by them. The question is,
did they give him such a promise, did they promise him liberty of
conscience, royal honour, and security for his followers, in the sense
in which he asked it?</p>

<p>A declaration of the governing committee in Scotland, which Colonel
Murray, who was to manage the mediation of the French crown with the
King, laid before Cardinal Mazarin in Paris, certainly says that the
King, if he comes into the Scottish camp, shall be received there
with honour, and stay there in all security: but there is bound up
with it the demand that he shall first assent to the introduction
of Presbyterianism, accept the conditions proposed at Uxbridge, and
make himself responsible for carrying these things forward with the
advice of the two Parliaments. In this case they promised him not only
security, but restoration to his dignity, greatness, and authority. It
appears that the committee hoped at this moment to carry its point, and
make Presbyterianism, with the King at the head, dominant in England
as well as in Scotland: it would not be content with any conditional
concession.</p>

<p>There is however no doubt that their plenipotentiary in France went a
step further. According to Mazarin’s assertion in an official document
(Bellièvre’s instructions), Murray, who worked in the profoundest
secrecy, since nothing must be known in London, expressly and directly
promised, in the name of the Scots, that the King should not be forced
in his conscience<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>. Murray afterwards made some other promises in
favour of his adherents, which the Scottish plenipotentiaries in London
confirmed, at least by word of mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span>

<p>Depending on this, and no doubt also on the influence which it could
always exert to procure the fulfilment of these promises, the French
government empowered its emissary, Montereuil, to promise all this
to King Charles in the name of the Queen-Regent and King of France:
honourable treatment suitable to his dignity, liberty of conscience, a
good reception for all who should accompany him, reconciliation with
his adherents, defence of his rights<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>.</p>

<p>Very far from finding the acceptance of these conditions degrading,
Charles I saw in them the foundation for a junction between the forces
still left to him and the Scottish army. He informed Montrose that
when the Scots should have openly declared themselves to this effect,
and guaranteed a complete amnesty to him, the Earl, and his adherents,
he might then unite his troops with those of the Parliament. When he
informed his wife, who had wished for the connexion with the Scots, of
his assent, he requested her to contrive that France should procure
him an honourable peace, or if such were not attainable, then should
support him with arms, in alliance with the States-General and the
Prince of Orange<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>. Always sanguine, and full of the highest hopes,
he thought he was forming an alliance which should yet gain him the
victory.</p>

<p>The Scots in the army however did not understand the matter thus. The
Chancellor had a meeting with the committee at Royston, the result of
which, to Montereuil’s astonishment, was quite different from what
had been promised him in London. They would have no open meeting with
the King, as this might involve them in difficulties with the English
Parliament. The King must declare that he was on his way to Scotland,
only under this pretext would they be able to receive him: but he must
not bring with him a single company of his troops. The stipulations
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> favour of his adherents were rejected or
limited; an immediate recognition of Presbyterianism was pointed out as
highly desirable. Montereuil did not know whether or not to advise the
King, under these limitations, to carry out the concerted plan.</p>

<p>While Charles was preparing with Prince Rupert, who in his growing
embarrassments had returned to his side and formed a guard for him,
to break through the hostile troops that were continually approaching
nearer, and so to push for Scotland, he received these tidings. He was
intensely disgusted, seeing in it a return of the Scots ‘to their old
detestable treachery’: for a moment all was in confusion.</p>

<p>In this grievous perplexity the King once more turned to the
Parliamentary troops of the Independent faction, and offered the
Commissary-General to come into the midst of them, if he would promise
to honour and maintain his royal dignity. The same proposal was also
made to some officers of the troops that were besieging Woodstock:
they agreed, if their superiors approved, to send safe conducts for
the King’s plenipotentiaries, with a view to closer conference: they
were expected at Oxford with the most painful anxiety, but they never
arrived. The Independent generals were not yet inclined to enter
blindly into relations with the King.</p>

<p>A detailed contemporary report relates that the King had yet a
third alternative offered to him, that the Lord Mayor of London had
undertaken to keep him safe if he came to the city, and that the plan
had even been formed for his appearance at a review of the militia,
fixed for May 5 in Hyde Park, but that Parliament had been informed
of the scheme and postponed the review. The story is of a somewhat
apocryphal character and wrong in its date<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>, and therefore cannot
be accepted; but it is true that a review was to have been held, and
was put off by Parliament on pretexts which have no importance<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>.
The Parliament declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> it to be high treason
secretly to receive and harbour the King: it forbade any Royalist to
remain in London or its vicinity. Its resolutions betray agitation, and
a fear that the King would find sympathy among the people. He would
not have been freed in London from the necessity of assenting to the
introduction of Presbyterianism; but the court at Oxford was convinced
that the city would not compel him to such hard conditions, and that
his liberty of conscience would be safer than with the Scots<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>. And
in fact the King all but took the way to London. He did not take his
two nephews with him, though that had been his intention hitherto, for
Rupert was easily recognisable by his great stature, and was hated in
the country. Attended only by his captain, Hudson, and the faithful
Ashburnham, whose servant he pretended to be, with a valise behind his
saddle, Charles I on April 27 quitted Oxford, and reached Brentford and
Harrow-on-the-Hill, in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital: and
here the King was very near venturing into London itself<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>. But the
vigilance of Parliament seems to have been too severe, his prospects
not clear enough. After remaining there two days in concealment, during
which fresh negotiations had been entered into with the Scots, he at
last resolved to betake himself to their camp at Newark. Although
his earlier dealings with them had had no result, yet he did not
appear quite as a fugitive seeking help. His arrival gave the Scots
an advantage; for they were much afraid of his falling, in one way or
another, into the hands of the Independents, and giving to their views
the authority of his name: it was much better and safer if the King
found shelter in their camp. The English troops who were taking part
in the siege of Newark, were not only astonished, but also jealous, at
seeing their King enter the abode of the French ambassador, near their
quarters in Southwell, and soon afterwards, surrounded by Scottish
troops, remove to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> the head-quarters of General
Lesley. The Scots were afraid that the English army, which was far
stronger than theirs, might try to carry off the King by force<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>. In
London this unexpected dénouement produced the greatest impression on
both sides. The Presbyterians were satisfied; the Independents, says
Baillie, were very wroth thereat.</p>

<p>After Newark had been surrendered to the English troops at the wish of
the Scots, with consent of the King—for they did not wish to excite
their jealousy any further—they hastened to conduct him to Newcastle,
near their own frontier. They knew perfectly well how valuable he
was to them. They calculated that his presence would serve to keep
in dependence the still unconquered Royalists in Scotland, and above
all the English Presbyterians. They thought further that the King
would ultimately not refuse to sign the Covenant, whereupon they would
strengthen his authority. Their object was to bring to completion that
combination which has been so often mentioned, with the French, the
King, and the English Presbyterians, who formed the most numerous party
in the country, and by this means to make head against the Independents.</p>

<span class="small">CHARLES I AT NEWCASTLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Externally the Scots treated the King with all the respect due to
his rank; but they allowed him no liberty whatever. On the march to
Newcastle, which was made with the utmost haste—for they were always
afraid of opposition from the Independent army—the King sought to
ascertain how they were inclined towards him from an officer whom he
trusted<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>. As this man was telling him that he must regard himself
as a prisoner, Lesley gave him a proof of the fact by peremptorily
interrupting the conversation. Only Montereuil, to whom it could
not be refused, was allowed to see the King occasionally; otherwise
no one was admitted. The sentinels posted round his quarters were
ordered to keep good watch on the windows, that letters might not be
thrown out unobserved and received below. The Scots wished to separate
their King from all the world, and keep him exclusively under their
own influence; for their main object was to induce him actually to
make the concessions which were necessary to the consolidation of
Presbyterianism in Scotland and in England.</p>

<p>As Charles I had already declared himself willing to receive
instruction in Presbyterianism, an attempt was first of all made to
convince him of the truth of that system. Alexander Henderson, whom the
King already liked, was immediately despatched to Newcastle, to ‘heal
the prince as a good physician of the predilection which he had for the
Episcopalian system.’ This predilection however was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1646.</span> King not merely a matter of feeling, but depended on
conviction, grounded on theological study. It has always been a
matter of wonder that the King was so well able, without extraneous
help, to encounter the trained Presbyterian controversialist in the
correspondence which was preferred to oral discussion<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>.</p>

<p>Above all things he maintained firmly that his standpoint was a sound
one both in right and historically, for that the English Reformation
had been made by those whose right to do so could not be called in
question, and that in it there had been no intention of abolishing
any of the things which had been in use in the Christian Church ever
since the times of the Apostles. Henderson repeated in relation to the
first point the old Scottish doctrine, that if the prince neglected
the necessary reformation, the right passed to the lower magistrates;
and in relation to Episcopacy, that it could not be shown to exist in
the first centuries. The King asked whether this last was not the case
with the Presbyterian system, for he thought that nothing had been
heard of it until Calvin. He required a scriptural proof of the lower
magistrates’ right to make reforms. Beyond this he added that he was
bound by the oath taken at his coronation to maintain the Episcopal
establishment. Henderson remarked that the oath lost its binding force
when remitted by those for whose advantage it was taken, as had been
done in the present case through Parliament. Charles answered that
he had taken this oath not to Parliament, but to the English Church,
which was not dependent on Parliament. Henderson replied that it was to
the Church in its entirety, for the safety of the people was ever the
highest law. The King did not admit that this constituted any release
from his oath, for on those grounds we might set aside all laws.</p>

<p>The King resisted Henderson’s arguments: but might he not be so far
impressed by them as to be inclined to give way on the representation
of its being absolutely necessary?</p>

<p>The English Parliament had again discussed the Uxbridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1646.</span> propositions, altered them in some points, and resolved
to present them once more to the King: but now no further negotiation
was to be allowed; he must accept the propositions simply, like
parliamentary bills. The Scots were affected by some of these
alterations; among others the control of military matters, over
which they had before been allowed some influence, was claimed
exclusively for the English Parliament. They were well aware of this,
but considering that the chief contents of the old propositions,
namely the abolition of the Episcopal system and the substitution of
Presbyterianism, were still retained, they deemed it better to give way
on the remaining points<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>. At the delivery of the propositions on
July 24 at Newcastle, the Chancellor of Scotland insisted as strongly
as possible that the King must accept them without further delay. He
told him plainly that if he refused he would lose all his friends in
Parliament, the city and the country, that England would rise as one
man against him, that they would bring him to trial, depose him, and
settle the kingdom without him to the ruin of him and his posterity.
But the King had already formed his resolution. He did not believe
that all the threats uttered by the Scots would be fulfilled, but if
even the worst came he would not yield to these demands. The English
commissioners declared, as they were instructed, that they could enter
into no discussion: their orders were to return within ten days to
London with Yes or No. The King however still gave an evasive answer,
insisting on the necessity of a fresh debate.</p>

<p>It was not in this Prince’s nature to give way to threats: the
expectation of a political reaction in his favour formed a stronger
inducement. The Scots had in view not merely the maintenance of their
control over the King: his compliance would also serve them as a weapon
against the Independents, whose influence in Parliament was daily
growing, from whom the greater stringency of the conditions had mainly
proceeded, and who wished for nothing so much as for the failure of all
negotiations. For what the Scots most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> wished,
the establishment of Presbyterianism, the Independents most abhorred.
It was clear that the King’s procrastinating answer, which they
represented as a refusal, was acceptable and advantageous to them.</p>

<p>Could no means be found, not so much for informing the King, for he
knew the facts already, but for convincing him that it was to his own
interest, since the Independents openly threatened the monarchy, to
unite against them with the Presbyterians, who would retain at least
the form of royal power? Might he not by this consideration be induced
to make a concession which otherwise he would refuse?</p>

<p>This was the point of view from which the state of things was
represented to the newly arrived French ambassador. It was the same
Bellièvre whom we have met with once before at a fatal moment as
representative of France in England. He renewed his old acquaintance
with Lord Holland, receiving his suggestions chiefly in the social
circles to which the latter belonged, at the houses of Lady Carlisle
and the Countess of Devonshire: but how different was their tone from
what it had been at the time of his first residence! Then Lord Holland
had been one of the most active leaders of the opposition to the King;
now he saw himself threatened by a party which had risen up since, far
more resolute, and really anti-monarchical: he and his friends sought
to lean on the King. Bellièvre was convinced that the further rise
of the Independents would annihilate the crown altogether, and that
the only escape lay in an alliance with the Presbyterians; for these
latter now again spoke favourably of monarchy: in London men seemed to
regret having gone so far, and declared themselves ready to restore
to the King such authority as his ancestors had possessed<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. The
Scots promised to intercede for the Queen, especially to procure the
return of the banished members of her household: but they insisted on
the unconditional and immediate acceptance of the propositions, for on
this it depended whether they could think of disbanding the army, which
would of itself put an end to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> the power of the
Independents; and then it would also be possible to limit the further
duration of the Parliament to a definite time, on the expiration of
which it should dissolve. They also gave a hope that the King might
be relieved from giving his personal adherence to the Covenant<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>.
The ambassador adopted these views without hesitation: he could see
no means of saving the crown and state of England except in the
unconditional acceptance by the King of the propositions offered. He
sent Montereuil to Paris, instructing him to use every means to induce
the court, in consideration of the pressing danger and of the private
interests of France, to approve the terms and recommend them to the
Queen, whose influence with the King gave some reason to expect that he
might even yet be induced to accept the propositions<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>.</p>

<p>The propositions of Newcastle were discussed in every shape in the
French council; but much as they wished to see an agreement between
the King and the Presbyterians, they never for an instant hesitated
to reject them, as ruinous to the Catholic Church and in complete
contradiction to the conditions claimed for the Queen of England:
moreover one king could not possibly advise another to strip himself of
the characteristic marks of sovereignty, which would be exciting all
neighbouring nations to similar rebellion. Queen Henrietta herself was
decidedly against it: the promise that the King should not be compelled
to sign the Covenant, and that Parliament should be dissolved, she
treated as vain and chimerical. Bellièvre had expressed the opinion
that the King might hereafter revoke what he now granted. The Queen
observed that if he signed the propositions he would give them legal
validity, and neither he nor his successors would ever be able to free
themselves from them, for the people would never suffer themselves to
be deprived of them again: he would be changing an usurpation into
a legal right. And when Bellièvre expressed the apprehension that
they would try the King and depose him, and set up an independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> government under the third prince, the Duke
of Gloucester, the Queen thought that even this would be better than
that Charles I should in solemn form deprive himself of his power,
and clothe Parliament with it. Cardinal Mazarin fully concurred in
all this; for they durst not let it come to pass that the King should
remain such in name only<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>.</p>

<p>Two points especially of the propositions repeated at Newcastle
appeared to France inadmissible; one, that the power to dispose of the
army and to raise the means necessary for its maintenance should be
given over for twenty years, dating from July 1, 1646, into the hands
of the Parliament, as well in Scotland as in England and Ireland;
the other that a great list should be drawn up of classes of persons
disqualified to receive any amnesty, comprising all those, Scots as
well as Englishmen, who had ever supported the King’s cause in the
field or in negotiations.</p>

<p>The French statesmen had a double motive for not wishing to give the
Independents the opportunity of possessing themselves of the supreme
authority: they were afraid of their anti-monarchical doctrines and
their general influence in Europe, but moreover they feared that Great
Britain might form a compact power on principles opposite to their
own. They did not however mean to avert these dangers by recommending
concessions which were contrary to monarchy as understood in France,
but by influence over the Scots and renewal of their league with them.</p>

<p>Bellièvre, who in his earlier mission had worked chiefly for this
object, was instructed to represent to them his astonishment that,
after giving the King, when at the advice of France and to their great
advantage he came to their camp, reason to hope for more favourable
terms, they should now wish to compel him to accept less favourable
ones: they would in this way make an enemy for ever of their King,
who might yet recover his power: but if they would support him now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> France would be for ever bound to them, would
not only secure them against the enmity of the English, but would even
take their part if Charles I should ever break his promises to them,
and would be inclined in the pending negotiations for a general peace
to make the concessions necessary for attaining it, so as to be able in
the next spring, before there was anything to be apprehended even from
the Independent army, to give them help<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>.</p>

<p>France was at this time at the height of her military power and
political influence in the world: she hoped before the end of the year
to establish her position by the conclusion of peace at Munster: and
then it was the purpose of her leading minister to interfere actively
in English affairs, and support with all his strength the union
between Charles I and the Scots, which he hoped meanwhile to bring to
completion<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>.</p>

<p>For this connexion concessions were necessary, and the French court was
entirely in favour of their being made, but not of so comprehensive a
kind as was demanded. Queen Henrietta Maria warned her husband afresh
against accepting the Covenant; but she admitted that Bellièvre was
right in thinking that the Episcopalian system must be given up. She
well knew, she said, how distasteful this was to the King, and it was
equally so to herself, but there was no means of saving the bishops
without ruining himself. If he fell they were irretrievably lost,
whereas he might restore them, if he again attained power. All seemed
to her to depend on his not giving up his prerogative in relation to
the armed force, the right of the militia; for then he would have the
means, and God would give him still more—she meant French help—to
restore all. The disorder in Ireland was dying out: she had received
from Scotland offers of great importance, and from the Queen of Sweden
satisfactory assurances of friendship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> If the
King stood fast, and abandoned neither his friends nor the right of the
militia, their cause might yet prosper.</p>

<p>Ever since July Bellièvre had been with the King at Newcastle. He had
entered into more intimate relations with him than might have been
expected from the incidents of his first mission, but they seemed
forgotten in the whirl of later events. Bellièvre wondered at the
tranquillity with which the King awaited the terrible events impending:
he said that he admired it, but could not imitate it<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>.</p>

<p>Some Scots also repaired to Newcastle, where the forms of the court
were still observed; amongst them Charles I’s old confidant, Hamilton,
who had been released in the course of events from his imprisonment
at Pendennis, appeared one day when the King gave audience. It was
observed that both blushed when their eyes met: Hamilton would have
retired among the rest of those present, but the King called him to
his side. In fact he had never believed in the actual guilt of his
old friend, and when he declared this, the old confidence was at once
restored between them: the King said that Hamilton would not quit him
in his misfortunes, and Hamilton replied that he was ready to fulfil
the King’s commands.</p>

<p>But thereupon Hamilton urged him to give way on the subject of
religion, as without this he would never win to his side either the
Scots or the city of London, on which all depended. Others, who were
regarded as a middle party between Argyle and Hamilton, promised the
King shelter in the country and armed assistance, but they made the
same condition. The King was firmly resolved not to accept it; and
among his attendants there was at least one who gave him some hope
that this unendurable necessity might be spared him. This was Murray,
who was on confidential terms with many leading men in England and
Scotland, and knew their opinions. The King formed a very close
intimacy with him, and with his aid in the first half of October
concocted an answer to the last propositions, which he hoped would find
acceptance in London and in time at least, might bring about a happy
result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span>

<p>It was not the French policy, though that was now backed by his wife,
whose counsels usually had the greatest weight with him, that the King
adopted: on the contrary, without any such exclusive reference to the
Scots as France recommended, he still hoped to attain his end by the
course of reconciliation with the English Parliament once before tried.
He accepted those of the propositions which related to repression
of the Papists: he declared himself ready to give satisfaction to
the Parliament in all that concerned Ireland, in reference to war
and religion: while pronouncing a general amnesty most desirable,
he promised to go as far in the way of limiting it as honour and
justice allowed. He said further that it was impossible for him to
deprive himself for ever of the sword, and place it unconditionally
in the hands of Parliament; but since it appeared necessary for the
establishment and security of peace, he would leave the right of the
militia by land and sea in the hands of Parliament for ten years,
on the condition however that afterwards it should stand as in the
times of his father and Queen Elizabeth. He implored the members of
Parliament, by their duty as Englishmen and Christians, to accept this
offer and thereby restore peace<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>.</p>

<p>There was still left the chief demand, concerning the abolition of the
Episcopalian establishment. The idea occurred to the King himself,
that in respect to this also he might by a temporary concession calm
their minds and at the same time not violate his conscience: everything
should stay for three years in the present condition, and during
that time the question should be discussed from all sides by a new
committee, and ultimately settled in the old parliamentary fashion.
Even about this he had scruples, and would not make the proposal until
he had received the assurance of two distinguished bishops—those of
London and Salisbury—that he might do so with an easy conscience<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>.
He requested them to tell him their opinion freely and candidly, as
they would answer for it at the Judgment Day. The bishops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1646.</span> answered that, assuming it to be the King’s firm resolve
not to depart from his coronation oath, and to maintain the Established
Church, to which end the new proposals were meant to serve, they were
of opinion that he would not be breaking his oath by making them, for
he was only allowing for a time what he could not prevent<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus assured by an episcopal judgment which he valued very highly, the
King offered to sanction the Presbyterian establishment with all its
forms, and the order of public worship already adopted, for a term of
three years, without prejudice to his own personal liberty: a definite
arrangement to be resolved on after that time by himself and the two
Houses of Parliament, after new consultations of the committee with the
Assembly of Divines<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>.</p>

<p>These were the first definite offers made by King Charles after his
defeat. They are closely connected with those suggested by him at
Uxbridge through his representatives; but compared with them are
certainly much more comprehensive. The right of the militia is handed
over to the Parliament, no longer for three years and jointly with the
King, but completely and for ten years. He offered not a meaningless
approximation to the Presbyterian system, but an effective recognition
of it for several years. Nevertheless his own standpoint, it is easy
to discern, was still not materially changed. The King contemplated a
return to the old state of things, unconditionally in respect to the
first point: as to the second he clearly expected that it would follow.</p>

<p>The doubt was whether he would effect anything by this. The first storm
he had to withstand was from his wife. She had wished, in accordance
with the French policy, that he should firmly hold to his temporal
rights and make extensive concessions as to religion. Instead of this
Charles I gave way a step further in temporal matters, but in religious
matters conceded so little that he could not have hoped to obtain any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1646.</span> result in Scotland. The Queen told him that he
seemed not to value the right of the militia highly enough, and that if
his conscience would allow him to comply in the religious question for
three years, he might well have given way further to save his kingdom.</p>

<p>The King was much concerned at the opposition of his wife, whose esteem
and love was a great consolation to him in all his troubles; but even
against her he stood firm. He replied that military strength did not
form so thoroughly stable a power in England as perhaps in France, and
that he did not surrender his rights: so too he held to his claims as
to religion—the temporary compliance which he offered would not wound
his conscience, but further he would not be urged to go. His previous
ill-fortune he regarded as the punishment of God for the weakness of
which he had been guilty in allowing the execution of Strafford and
the exclusion of the bishops from Parliament. The abolition of the
Episcopalian system would be a relapse into the same error, would draw
down the wrath of God upon him afresh, and deprive him of his settled
peace of mind—he should fall into despair.</p>

<p>Charles then had an idea of resigning the supreme power to the Prince
of Wales; if he could reconcile it to his conscience to make greater
concessions to the Scots, he might do so. But neither his wife nor
the Prince would hear of this: Mazarin also and Bellièvre deemed the
project too dangerous. They would have been afraid of a republic being
immediately proclaimed, and perhaps obtaining control of the three
kingdoms.</p>

<p>As the royal authority could not be induced to grant the chief
demand of the Scots, the French had no other resource for carrying
out their plan, except to try how far the Scots would be satisfied
with the King’s concessions. At the beginning of December, 1646,
his answer to the propositions was sent to them, and met with a
very unfavourable reception. The limitation to three years of the
recognition of Presbyterianism, the exemption of the royal family
from all pledges to conform to it, the entire omission of any mention
of the Covenant, displeased the zealous Scots in the highest degree.
The French did not yet despair of bringing about a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1646.</span> understanding: once more Montereuil repaired to Scotland
with instructions to suggest a prospect of the open intervention of
France in favour of the King, and to promise splendid rewards to all
who should take part in the great work of restoring the King<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>.
Montereuil spoke first with Hamilton and his friends: they assured him
that they were ready to shed their blood for their King, but that they
should be able to achieve nothing for him with their countrymen unless
he signed the Covenant. Montereuil hurried next to the middle party,
with which Bellièvre had had dealings, Traquair, Calander, Roxburgh,
Morton: they declared that they could do nothing without the Hamiltons,
and also required the concession which was not to be obtained from
the King. In Parliament a resolution was passed in opposition to more
moderate proposals, to insist on the acceptation of the propositions
as a whole, and if the King refused, to provide for the government of
the country without him. The Church Assembly expressed itself to the
same effect: the King should never be received in the country unless he
accepted the Covenant, and gave a satisfactory answer in respect to the
propositions<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus this negotiation also miscarried. Bellièvre attempted to open to
the King the chance of flight to Ireland or the Scottish Highlands,
for he must stay in one of his kingdoms, so as to be able to form a
party: but even an attempt at such a thing proved impracticable; in
consequence of a fresh turn in politics the vigilance around his person
had been doubled.</p>

<p>Turning away from all dealings which might lead to a one-sided
alliance with the King and with France, the Scots had again come to
terms with the English Parliament. Their religious zeal was satisfied
by Presbyterianism being now in fact introduced into England: lay
elders had been chosen and church sessions established in London: the
Assembly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> of Divines were proceeding to compile
a catechism and confession. The Scots had no objection to the King
being kept for the future in custody in England: they hoped that either
he would thus be brought to accept the propositions, or that without
this form they would succeed in carrying out their old purposes. This
concession was joined to a new agreement, whereby all differences
between England and Scotland were fully settled: the English agreed to
pay all arrears due to the Scots, £400,000 in all, £200,000 at once in
two instalments: the Scots agreed to quit England; the first instalment
was to be paid to them before they recrossed the Tyne, the second
directly afterwards.</p>

<p>We shall soon see what views, as against other common enemies, were at
the bottom of this reconciliation. The immediate consequence was that
the King’s answer to the propositions had no effect in England; for as
the Scots, who had no reason for being entirely satisfied with them,
held firmly to them, it was not likely that the English Parliament,
from which they proceeded, should abandon them. It was agreed that
the King should be brought to Holmby House, and remain there until he
gave his assent to the last proposals: the Scots only stipulated that
the constitution should not be further altered, nor the succession
interfered with. The moderate members of the English Parliament readily
assented, for they hoped, having these fixed points to rely on, that
they would be better able to resist the opposite party, which aimed at
abolishing the monarchy. The Presbyterians of the two countries, being
thus united, hoped to establish for ever their joint supremacy.</p>

<p>The execution of these arrangements, when once decided on, was not
delayed for a moment. The money payment was brought in a somewhat
offensive way into connexion with the surrender of the King. On January
21, 1646/7, Thursday, the first payment towards the stipulated sum
was made near Northallerton, both parties appearing with military
escorts: on the following Saturday the English commissioners arrived
at Newcastle, to inform the King that he must follow them. It was
Lord Pembroke, who in the most submissive form, not omitting the
three reverences practised at Whitehall, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1647.</span> these announcements to the King. He told him that he was
deputed by Parliament to follow him to Holmby, and be at his service
on the journey<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>. The King as usual begged for time to consider
it. He spoke first with the deputies from Scotland, who gave him to
understand, though in the gentlest terms which they could find, that
the Scottish Parliament fully concurred. They informed him that their
garrison would quit Newcastle, and an English one enter in their stead.
On Saturday, the 30th, the Scots quitted Newcastle, and the English
entered: in the afternoon an English guard entered the King’s presence
under arms instead of the Scottish one. The Scottish deputies left him,
after presenting a declaration of their Parliament in relation to his
surrender: and the English entered in their stead: the latter told him
that he would be received with joy by his people (always assuming that
he accepted the Covenant), and that never had a King been more powerful
in England than he should be. He fixed February 3 for the day of his
departure: they made short journeys by day, so as not to be exposed at
night-fall to any disasters, or inconvenient demonstration. All the
magic effect of the reverence, which for centuries had been shewn to
the wearer of the crown, still remained with Charles I. Crowds streamed
in from all sides, in order to be cured, according to the old belief,
by his health-giving touch, in such numbers that the concourse had to
be stopped by proclamation. When they reached Holmby—a country house
built by Christopher Hatton in the splendid style of the Elizabethan
age, that at a later date had passed into the hands of the royal
family—the strictest confinement was ordered as lately at Newcastle.
No man durst approach the King, who had not committed himself to the
new order of things by accepting the protest and the Covenant. Even
of these the sentinels let none pass, who could not produce written
leave from the commissioners, through whose hands all letters which
concerned him, had to pass. The treatment of the King recalls what his
grandmother Mary Stuart had to endure at Fotheringhay: the difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> was that his life was secured by treaty with the
Scots; and the prevailing Parliamentary authority, at least in most
part of the members constituting it, was in fact of opinion that the
promise should be kept.</p>

<span class="small">THE PARLIAMENT AND ARMY AT VARIANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It has always been a matter of surprise, both at the time and since,
that King Charles attached so much importance to the maintenance
of Episcopacy, even more than to the preservation of his military
prerogative. In one of his letters to his wife he writes that a King
of England, even if he remains in possession of military power,
will have but little enjoyment of it, so long as obedience is not
preached from the pulpits, and that this can never be obtained from
the Presbyterians: for their view was to wrest from the crown its
ecclesiastical authority, and place it in the hands of Parliament, and
also to introduce the doctrine that the supreme power belongs to the
people, that the prince may be called to account and punished by them,
and that resistance to him is a lawful thing<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>. To these views and
doctrines Charles I would not submit, being every moment conscious that
he was contending for right by the grace of God, for the old personal
authority of the crown.</p>

<p>Even in the condition of strict imprisonment in which he was kept, he
still possessed power, and felt it. The Lower House changed a number
of the propositions rejected by him—for instance the abolition of
Episcopacy, and the arrangements about the military authority—into
ordinances; but laws they could not become without the King’s assent:
it was felt to be of some importance to obtain it from him. Moreover
there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> were other complications which made the
Parliament anxious for its own sake to come to terms with the King.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian majority proceeded to execute its great long-prepared
and decisive scheme for putting down the Independents. It was this
purpose which was originally at the bottom of their connexion with the
Scots, in conformity to the interests of both parties. The Scots agreed
so easily to quit England, in order to remove the pretext on which the
retention of an army in England was justified. To disband the army
would be the ruin of the entire party which relied upon it. For the
same reason the city lent the money requisite to content the Scots and
induce them to depart. The agreement by which the King was delivered
into the hands of the English Parliament was intended to serve also
as a reason for disbanding the army, now that all that quarrel was
terminated<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>. Under the additional influence of various petitions
which came in from all parts of the country against burdening it any
longer with the cost of a standing army which was no more wanted, the
Lower House at the beginning of March 1647 passed several comprehensive
resolutions about the further destination of the army.</p>

<p>Now that England was at peace it was time to put an end to the truce
in Ireland, and prosecute the war there with all vigour. For this
purpose it was deemed advisable to send to Ireland seven regiments
of foot and four of horse, 11,400 men in all, all of whom were to be
taken from the standing army under General Fairfax. In England only so
many troops were to be retained as were necessary for garrisoning the
fortified places. County by county the fortresses were enumerated which
were to be kept or to be razed: by far the greater part were doomed to
demolition. The numbers of the army being thus considerably reduced,
care was further taken for securing their absolute obedience. On March
8 a resolution was passed that no member of the Lower House should
hold a command in these garrisons or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> in the
army, and that no higher military rank than colonel should be suffered
to exist under the General-in-Chief: a majority of 136 votes against
108 further decided that the officers of the army should one and all
accept the Covenant, and conform to the church system established by
Parliament<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>.</p>

<p>It is obvious that if these resolutions were carried out the
Independentism of the army would no longer be dangerous,—for this very
reason it was inevitable that resistance should be offered to them.</p>

<p>How long and strenuously had Parliament contended with the King for the
right to control the army. It is a sort of irony of success that now
it was as far as possible from being master of the very army which had
been formed under its eyes.</p>

<p>On March 21 the officers of all ranks had assembled in Thomas Fairfax’s
head-quarters at Saffron-Walden: when the demand was laid before them
to enter for service in Ireland, they gave it to be understood that
they could not do so until satisfactory answers were given to several
questions, especially who was to command in Ireland, how the army was
to be ensured its arrears for past service, its pay for the future,
and an indemnity for all previous acts. In reply the Parliament
resolved to set apart for the army a considerable sum (£60,000 a
month), and it seemed as if this would have an influence on the
decision of the officers. Hereupon several captains showed themselves
inclined to enter on the new service, but the rest, all the colonels,
lieutenant-colonels, and majors present, a great number of captains and
some lieutenants adhered to their resolutions of the previous day.</p>

<p>It is known from the German wars what a tendency to independence
prevailed generally in the armies of that age. The English army did not
scruple to make known its views in the manner then usual in political
bodies. A petition was despatched to Parliament in which it disclaimed
every sort of obligation except to do England service, and insisted in
the name of all, that before the army was disbanded every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1647.</span> officer’s claims should be settled and an indemnity granted
for every unlawful act done on service<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. The petition breathes a
haughty consciousness of strength, and is a manifesto of independence.
Parliament was highly offended, and did not delay to express its
disapproval, offering forgiveness to all who receded from the petition,
but declaring all who continued to urge it enemies of the public peace
and of the state. Nevertheless it did not hesitate to proceed with
the affair. The Common Council of the city proving willing to grant a
new loan, it was possible to provide abundant pay for the two armies,
both that which was to stay at home and that destined for Ireland,
especially for the latter. Indeed a new commission which was sent to
Saffron-Walden met with great opposition. The majority of the officers
desired above all things to stay with their generals, and to be charged
<i>en masse</i> with the expedition to Ireland: but there were some
who gave ear to the requests of the commissioners. The Parliament
named General Skippon, who enjoyed the confidence of the army, as
field-marshal for Ireland, and after some hesitation he accepted the
appointment. Gradually no small number of officers declared themselves
ready to go to Ireland, seventeen from the cavalry, eighty-seven from
nine separate regiments of foot, seven from the dragoons; these were
mostly subalterns, but some few were colonels, and there were several
captains. They hoped to be able to send a considerable army to Ireland,
about 5000 infantry<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>.</p>

<p>Then however it was shown that in this army the privates were not so
absolutely dependent on their officers as in the German armies. The
religious impulse which had drawn every man into the ranks produced
a feeling of individual rights, and of spontaneity of action, which
destroyed the dependence of military subordination. A distinguished
colonel, who with several of his officers was gained over for service
in Ireland, was unable to bring one of his men with him. In other
regiments and companies a certain number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> of
them followed, but always far less than half. Manifestations now
appeared not merely of disobedience but of hostility. Every man had
taken up arms for the sake of the sect to which he belonged: he would
not lay them down with the prospect that this sect would thereupon be
oppressed. Moreover far-reaching political tendencies also prevailed.
In an address which the military representatives elected by the
separate companies—those Agitators who had yet a great part to
play—presented to their most celebrated generals, Fairfax, Cromwell,
and Skippon, they mentioned besides the satisfaction of their own
claims, the security of the rights and liberties of the subject.
They spoke very offensively of the leaders of the Presbyterian party
in Parliament, describing them as men who, having been raised above
their proper sphere of subordinate service, had acquired a taste
for sovereign power, and took pleasure in a tyrannical exercise of
it—expressions which amounted to a declaration of open hostility.</p>

<p>It was now that the leaders of the moderate party in Parliament, and
some personages outside it, turned their eyes again upon the King.
Union with him, whereby the measures adopted by them against their
opponents would have obtained the sanction of a higher authority, would
have been of infinite value to them. Parliament, which was bound by
previous resolutions, could not officially consent to the proposals
contained in the King’s last answer from Newcastle; but in secret they
found numerous supporters. When Bellièvre returned from Newcastle to
London, he observed an inclination, quite unexpected by him, to make
terms with the King on this basis. Holland, Warwick, Manchester, and
the two ladies who had so much influence in the Presbyterian party, the
Countesses of Carlisle and Devonshire, declared themselves satisfied
with the King’s last concessions in respect to the militia and the
Irish war, as well as with the introduction of Presbyterianism for
three years. They only asked for one thing more—that the King should
declare himself ready to recognise the arrangements made by Parliament
under the Great Seal, which seemed to them absolutely necessary for
their personal safety: but after that he might return to London to meet
the Parliament, in order to make a definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span>
reconciliation; and they thought that they could promise him a good
reception in the city. The Royalists, who had come to London in numbers
from the places captured by the army, maintained there a tone of
feeling favourable to the King, which reacted on Parliament. Bellièvre
was convinced that this result would soon and easily be realised.
An important weight was thrown into the same scale by the Earl of
Northumberland, who had for a long time sided with the Independents,
from dislike to the Scots, but now returned to his old Presbyterian
friends. Bellièvre most urgently recommended the attempt both to the
King, with whom he had found means to keep up his communication, and to
the Queen, and to the French court.</p>

<p>The course taken by France was once more decided by general politics.
Seeing that the Spaniards and their allies—for peace had not long
been concluded—exhibited themselves as opponents of King Charles
and friends of the Independents, it appeared advantageous to effect
as a counterpoise a connection with the King and the moderate
Parliamentarians<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>.</p>

<p>Queen Henrietta Maria, to whom the proposals were again communicated,
was annoyed that everything issued under the Great Seal should be
legalised in the lump; no one knew, she said, what might not be
included. She had no objection to the Lords seeking advantage and
safety for themselves, but she required in that case a general amnesty,
so that she might not see her own adherents excluded<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.</p>

<p>This was also the point of view of the King, who was very unwilling
to concede anything until he should be again a free man; then, he
said, he would grant to his Parliament everything which could be given
consistently with honour and a good conscience<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>. He wished to
ascertain definitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> from the Lords what he
had to expect from them. The Queen urged the Earl of Northumberland to
promise that he would declare for the King in case Parliament was not
to be gained. And so things went on, with much expenditure of words,
without any agreement being arrived at, though on the whole all had the
same intention.</p>

<p>The Upper House resolved that it would be well for the King to come
to Oatlands, so as to be nearer Parliament; but as some difficulties
might be expected to be raised, it was suggested that he should escape
by flight from his detention at Holmby, and come to the city. He might
merely alight at the Lord Mayor’s, appear in Parliament under the
escort of that portion of the citizens which was devoted to him, and
thence repair to Whitehall. The Countesses of Carlisle and Devonshire
recommended this plan, though they could not suggest the proper means
for executing it: not only Warwick and Holland and many English
Presbyterians, but also some Scots were in favour of it. Bellièvre
undertook to arrange it with the King<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.</p>

<p>While the Parliamentary leaders were thus pursuing more eagerly than
ever the idea of an accommodation with the King, they made at the same
time earnest preparations for either keeping the army in obedience,
or getting rid of it altogether. In reply to the complaints of the
troops Parliament agreed to concessions in respect to indemnity and
security for arrears, but insisted on the army being disbanded. On May
25 it issued an order prescribing the mode in which this should take
place in the different regiments, fixing the place and the day, and
the direction in which those were to move who would take service in
Ireland. Commencement was to be made on June 1 with Fairfax’s regiment:
the commissioners of Parliament, among them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span>
Earl of Warwick, set out with the money required for completing it.</p>

<p>Once more there was a great opportunity for the Presbyterian schemes:
removal of the Independent opposition, reconciliation with the King,
and alliance with France, seemed all attainable in the immediate
future. But, as has been said, this danger stimulated all the strength
of the Independents, thus threatened, and in itself so powerful. The
time was come when they must decide whether to yield to the majority of
Parliament, or to offer resistance. Should the generals and colonels,
who not unjustly asserted that they had done most in the war with the
King, obey an authority formed on the basis of their victory, but
established with no legal warranty, and in itself unconsolidated, if
it issued orders which were ruinous to them? Should the soldiers too
surrender the religious independence for which they had taken up arms,
for a system no less oppressive to them than the old one, and submit to
a new yoke? With these considerations of personal interest was united
a dislike to a close connexion with the Scots, and to their influence,
which threatened to make England dependent on foreign counsels. As
matters stood then it may well be maintained that for the future and
the greatness of England, both in the British Islands and in the world
at large, more was to be expected from the continued freedom of the
army and its further victories, than from the treaties and alliances of
the Presbyterians.</p>

<p>That all this was fully considered we cannot suppose: but hostilities
and oppositions are at once personal and ideal: the contending factions
were maintaining at the same time their own private cause and one of
public importance.</p>

<p>The disbanding could not be accomplished at once. A petition in the
name of the soldiery proposed a general assembly: the officers thought
it impossible to refuse such a meeting, because it could not well
be prevented, and would be all the more dangerous if held without
the officers: while assenting to the petition, they at the same time
requested the general to press Parliament to revise the order for
disbanding, and also to postpone the operation of it. What if it
should be still persisted in? On the appointed day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1647.</span> June 12, the commissioners appointed to execute it in Fairfax’s
regiment arrived at head-quarters. In order to avoid an immediate
conflict the regiment determined to move off: the major took possession
of the colours and led the troops, as if it were done on his own
account, to the appointed place of meeting. The same feelings prevailed
in the other regiments and their commanders: of all the colonels
perhaps only six did not concur.</p>

<p>With this evasive disobedience was joined an act of the most arbitrary
character. The army could not and would not let the King go to London:
for then, in one way or another, the scheme already projected would
have been executed, and through the newly-awakened sympathies of
the Londoners a royalist combination might have been completed. The
powerless King formed a subject of jealousy between the different
parties. Parliament had been unwilling to leave him in the hands of
the Scots: the army resolved to withdraw him from the influence of
Parliament.</p>

<p>On June 2, 1647, King Charles I had already retired to rest at Holmby,
when a couple of squadrons of Cromwellian horse appeared before the
house, under a cornet named Joyce, who, though without any producible
warrant<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>, appeared with so much authority that the audience which
he demanded to have immediately could not be refused to him. He then
informed the King that the army, fearing that Parliament would carry
him off and raise other troops in his name, requested him to follow
him. As the commissioners could offer no resistance, the King assented,
only expressing the supposition that he would be treated with the
respect due to him, and would not be oppressed in his conscience. Next
morning he had this confirmed by the assembled soldiers, and then for
the first time asked for the cornet’s warrant. He said that his warrant
was the men behind him: the King replied laughing, that it was a
warrant which needed no spelling. ‘But what would you do, if I did not
follow you? You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> would not, I think, lay hands
on me; for I am your King: no one is above me, save God alone<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>.’</p>

<p>The King had been transferred without difficulty from the custody
of the Scots to that of Parliament; for therein, as he said at the
time, he changed only his place, and not his condition: he now with a
certain appearance of free-will followed the stronger power. He had
as yet no knowledge of the plan of flight to London: the letter in
which Bellièvre informed him of it is dated on that very 2nd of June:
it was still doubtful whether he would even come to terms with the
Presbyterians. Meanwhile he felt daily and hourly the pressure of their
treatment: the Independents, from their principles, were more tolerant
gaolers.</p>

<p>This falling into the hands of the army, in which fundamentally
anti-monarchical principles were dominant, was a decisive event in
Charles I’s history. Who gave instructions for carrying him off? Who
was the leader in the matter? Parliament at the time, like all its
contemporaries and posterity, had no doubt that Cromwell was the soul
of it all. Just at this time the purpose of arresting him had again
been formed, but he had gone to the army at the right moment. Even now
he remained entirely in the background. The order executed by Joyce
proceeded not from him, but from a committee of the soldiers.</p>

<p>The King was immediately conducted to the neighbourhood of Newmarket,
where the announced general meeting of the troops took place. His
presence, which secured the army against the formation of a threatening
combination, doubtless also contributed to its assuming a haughtier
attitude, and openly avowing aggressive purposes. The army declared the
resolution for disbanding it to be the work of evil-minded men, whose
object was simply to separate officers and men, and then to ill-use
both at their pleasure: it required, besides the removal of remaining
grievances, security against this danger, which would last so long
as those men were of consideration and influence in Parliament, and
security too of a kind with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> which the great
council of the army, consisting of the generals and two officers and
two privates from each regiment, should be satisfied.</p>

<p>What was now only intimated, was directly announced a few days
later<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>. The army demanded that Parliament should be cleared of the
persons displeasing to it: they mentioned eleven by name, including
Hollis, Stapleton, Clotworthy, and William Waller, who had acted
against the army and the rights of the subject, and therefore ought not
to sit in Parliament. With this they united still more comprehensive
intentions. They condemned the perpetual Parliament, and required,
though not immediately, new elections and periodical meetings of
Parliament. In their memorials, which were said to be composed by
Ireton, appear ideas of the most extensive import, at present only in
distant perspective, but which were soon to be further developed.</p>

<p>Parliament, having the capital mainly on its side, still thought itself
capable of resistance. The city troops were strengthened, and a guard
formed for Parliament: reformed officers were taken into their service.
A resolution passed at an earlier date, forbidding the army to approach
within twenty-five miles of the capital, was called to remembrance, and
the old committee of safety re-established.</p>

<p>We know however how narrow was the majority which gave Parliament its
present Presbyterian character. All depended on party, the assembly
as a whole had no proper <i>esprit de corps</i>. Instead of opposing
the now advancing army with firmness, the majority in Parliament, in
consequence of its approach, were doubtful and pliant. They revoked
the commissions given for preparations, and recalled the expressions
which had most offended the army: as moreover the eleven accused
members thought it best to depart (they received leave of absence for
six months), the Independent interest was now the stronger: Parliament
consequently annulled the elections to the committee on the city
militia, by which the Independents had been excluded, and assented to
the King’s following the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span>

<p>A firmer temper was exhibited in the city, where the Presbyterianism
of the citizens was kept in constant excitement by the preachers, who
saw in the predominance of the Independents a danger to the faith
and to the safety of their souls, so that now the offers which the
King again issued appeared very acceptable. Moreover the old royalist
interest reappeared in all its strength: an association was planned,
in which citizens, militia, sailors, and students united, so as to
conclude peace on the basis of his last intimations through personal
communication with him: it was declared the cause at once of God and of
the King, in which no neutrality was admissible.</p>

<p>Although this pledge was rejected in Parliament, and it was even
declared high treason to sign it, the only immediate effect was to
inflame still more the zeal of the citizens: as they observed that the
change of opinion in Parliament resulted from the influence of the
army, they thought that they also had a right to maintain their views
in opposition. On Monday, July 26, the Common Council proceeded to
the House of Lords, and obtained, by the aid of a tumultuous mob, the
repeal of the last resolution, as well as of another relating to the
city militia. Thence the mob turned to the Lower House: it consisted of
lads from the workshops, sailors, and discharged soldiers: they came
into the chamber with their hats on, and in violent haste demanded a
division on the same proposals. The Commons kept them at bay for some
time, hoping for aid from the Mayor or the Sheriffs: the former did not
stir, the Sheriffs appeared with some halberdiers, who however declined
to interfere. Late in the evening the Commons resolved to follow the
example of the Lords. The mob allowed no one to quit the House until
the clerk had legalised what had been done with the ancient forms<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>.</p>

<p>The power of the Long Parliament was based on its understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> with the city and the army: but now the
influence of these two allies became antagonistic to each other. By
far the greater part of the members, including some of Presbyterian
opinions, with the Speakers of the two Houses, fled from the violence
of the city to the army head-quarters. Fairfax and Cromwell now did
what Essex had avoided doing in a similar case: they welcomed the
fugitives. The city on the contrary made itself responsible for
guarding the assembly, such as it had become after the return of the
eleven members and the departure of so many others. The city, in
its official character, ordered the army to advance no further, as
it would be a breach of the privileges of London. And in case this
should still happen it prepared to defend against the Independents the
fortifications which had been erected against the royalist troops.
An invitation was sent to the King himself to come to London, where
freedom, security, and honourable treatment should be his portion.
General Massey, who had made a name by the defence of Gloucester,
was with great confidence appointed to defend London. The forts were
occupied, and cannon placed on the ramparts: the youths crowded
to serve. An Independent demonstration in the streets, in which
the Catholics joined, was put down by the superior strength of the
Presbyterians, as the city of London was regarded as their chief
stronghold: a dangerous war between the armed force and the capital
seemed to be impending<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>.</p>

<p>Determined to overpower this opposition, which they did not rate
very high, the Independent army gathered from all directions on
Hounslow Heath. Fairfax issued a manifesto wherein he also, like the
King, declared that after the previous tumults and the flight of the
two Speakers, there was no longer at Westminster a lawful and free
Parliament, it was <i>ipso facto</i> suspended; that all resolutions
passed by it were in their nature null and void, and that the army
was advancing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span> <span class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1647.</span> London to reinstate
the Speakers and the fugitive members, in whom it recognised the true
Parliament, to restore to the assembly freedom to sit and vote, and
to punish the acts of violence that had been committed. The fugitive
members, fourteen of them from the House of Lords, about a hundred from
the Commons, appeared on Hounslow Heath. They accompanied Fairfax at a
review, and rode with him along the front of the regiments. Everywhere
they were received with demonstrations of joy, and the cry of ‘Free
Parliament!’ Their presence afforded the army not only a pretext, but a
justification for its undertaking to advance against the capital.</p>

<p>The army during the last year had been continually recruited afresh
and was in excellent condition. Its advance was assisted by the
suburb of Southwark, which had contemptuously declined to take part
in the measures adopted in the city, and had refused the artillery
sent thither. And had it come to a conflict, the Independents within
the city, who had been conquered but by no means annihilated, would
infallibly have risen to support the attack. Who would be answerable
for the bloodshed and confusion which must follow?</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common
Council, resolved on the afternoon of August 3 to make peaceful terms
with the army. They adopted the declaration of the generals—for how
could they venture to defend the injustice that had been done, though
perpetrated by their own party and with their co-operation—that
the army only sought to replace the fugitive members and restore a
free Parliament, and declared that they would open their gates with
pleasure, both to the members themselves and to two or three regiments
as their escort<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>. At the further demand of Fairfax they evacuated
the fortifications on the west side of the city. On August 6 Fairfax
entered London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> with four regiments and his
bodyguard. In the midst of the column appeared the carriages of the
two Speakers and the returning members. The soldiers wore laurel
branches in their hats: it seemed more like a mere procession than
taking victorious possession. In Hyde Park they were received by the
Lord Mayor, at Charing Cross by the Common Council: all seemed like
the result of a friendly agreement. The members of the two Houses
immediately resumed their places, the Speakers their old seats.</p>

<p>The relation of parties was not yet fully defined by this, for many
Presbyterians had fled and returned with the rest. Still it is obvious
how great an advantage the Independents had won thereby. The army,
which should have been disbanded, took up a dominant position (it
occupied Southwark and Hammersmith) over against the city, in which the
entire strength of its opponents was concentrated.</p>

<span class="small">INFLUENCE OF THE AGITATORS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>No one could yet have said which course events would take; either
opposite still seemed possible, the abolition or the complete
restoration of the monarchy, exclusive domination of one religious
faction or tolerance of several, continuance or abridgment of
Parliament, entire supremacy of the army, or union with other powers,
maintenance of the laws, or even social reform. To estimate the
contrary expectations that existed it is only necessary to know that
the Pope at Rome solemnly took counsel as to how far the English
Catholics should be authorised to unite with the Independents. It
was maintained with a certain confidence that the Independents would
restore the King and the episcopal establishment, but introduce
universal toleration<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>.</p>

<p>The King found himself not altogether in bad hands. He was again
allowed Anglican worship: some old servants, like Berkeley and
Ashburnham, were permitted to be near him: his children were brought to
him, his friends might visit him. He again received foreign ambassadors
with a certain ceremony in the hall at Hampton Court, devoted from old
times to this purpose: the commissioners who surrounded him appeared as
his ministers, though forced upon him. The King asserted that he had
the word of the chief officers that his crown should not be assailed:
in return he had promised not to quit Hampton Court without previous
reference to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> them<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. In the style used in
the last generation by Cuneo, the terms of the oath of allegiance to
be taken by the Catholics was then discussed between them and the
King<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>.</p>

<p>Parliament, in spite of the influence which the Independents had
exerted on its present position, and still exercised every moment in
its debates, passed a resolution in favour of once more laying before
the King the Newcastle propositions, which were based on the full
supremacy of Presbyterianism, and requesting his acceptance of them:
for this was required by the agreement with the Scots, a link they were
unwilling to break.</p>

<p>The Independents allowed this to be done, but meanwhile entered into
separate negotiations with the King, in which terms of an entirely
opposite character were put forward. According to these the Parliament
was immediately to be transferred to Oxford, and dissolved within
some three months; the troops were to retire from the capital and
deliver up to the city militia the posts which they had occupied. The
Episcopate was to be restored to its undoubted rights, corresponding
to the old laws; but at the same time there was to be complete liberty
of conscience: no man was to be vexatious to another in matters of
conscience, or oppress him in such<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>. At an earlier time it had
been stipulated that some specially detested adherents of the King
(seven in number, though not named) should be excluded from the general
amnesty. Now, only four were named—Bristol and Digby, Worcester and
Newcastle: some others were to be threatened with banishment and
temporary sequestration of their property. Finally, a more popular
system of administration of justice was contemplated. The King was
astonished at the extent of these proposals, but, as he was rightly
told, had they been less comprehensive he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> would
not have ventured to believe in their sincerity. They bore on the face
of them the character of Independentism: he could not accept them as
they stood, but in several points they pleased him better than the
Presbyterian terms. To the proffer of the old propositions he replied
that the scheme of the army seemed to him better suited to form the
foundation for a lasting peace. He protested afresh his determination
to secure the Protestant creed with reservation of some indulgence
for tender consciences, the liberty of the subject, the privileges
of Parliament, and the laws: at the same time he expressed a wish to
discuss these propositions in personal intercourse with Parliament and
make the acceptance of them possible. It is known that this answer was
composed in concert with Ireton and Cromwell, in a garden house at
Putney, where the head-quarters of the army lay. The two leaders gave
it to be understood that they intended to base a definite treaty on
these proposals. Ireton said that if Parliament made opposition, it
should be cleansed of the obstructives, and cleansed again until an
agreement was obtained. Cromwell smote on his breast, and begged the
King to have confidence<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>.</p>

<p>Cromwell then spoke with full appreciation of the moral attitude of
the King, and referred with emotion to the scene of meeting with his
children: he exhibited even a sense of the importance of the monarchy.
He was heard to say that no man was secure of life and property unless
first of all the King obtained his rights. To other officers, as well
as to him, it seemed the most suitable plan, considering the unbroken
strength of their opponents and the possibility of a reaction, to
secure their own future by a treaty with the King and Parliament. Their
expressions have been declared to be hypocritical, in fact merely
intended to deter the King from accepting the other propositions,
but this in any case it was certain he would never do. Moderate
Independents might honestly seek to discover the points in which their
interests would coincide with those of the King and the Presbyterians;
they might wish to bring about a treaty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> which
could be accepted by all<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>. No doubt the interest of the army would
always have weighed most with them, only they would have taken account
of the two other parties. It was a view which was suggested by the
state of things, and at the time filled the whole horizon; but it was
certainly such as men’s views usually are, when they are still under
general discussion, and being neither definitely formulised nor fixed
by binding agreements, may be given up again without scruple.</p>

<p>What was to happen if the hostility of the contending interests proved
unconquerable. In the army itself there was still a powerful faction
which would listen to none of these agreements. It is not in fact true,
as has been asserted ever since, that every kind of manifestation in
the army proceeded from the generals themselves. It had long before
been perceived that in the Independent party there were two separate
views current. The leaders would have been content with an arrangement
with the King on the terms accepted in his answer, the mass would not
have been satisfied with this<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>. Still less would the latter have
been contented with the concessions now contemplated.</p>

<p>When the King said that tender consciences must be spared, this was
by no means the liberty of conscience which the Independents on
principle desired. The King was willing only to admit a limitation of
authority in church matters: their theory, on the contrary, aimed at
the separation of Church and State. They refused to the civil power any
authority to interfere in matters of religion, as every man had a right
to believe and to worship God as he pleased<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.</p>

<p>More than this, they desired a fundamental change in the State and the
Government, not a mere union of the Independent and Parliamentarian
magnates with the King, which would merely lead once more to the
old oppression. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> army had taken up arms
to restore the rights and liberties of the nation, according to its
judgment and conscience; but as yet nothing had been changed, either in
the oppressive administration of justice, or in the arbitrary dealings
of Parliamentary committees, or in the burden of tithes and the excise,
or in the persecution of the faithful.</p>

<p>These sentiments now found their regular expression in the
above-mentioned institution of Agitators, a name which characterised
the thing exactly. It was intended to form a representation of the
troops. Elections were held in the companies, and from those elected
the agents or Agitators were chosen by a second process of election;
agents they were meant to be, Agitators they became: but they were
intended to represent the interests not of the separate divisions
but of the whole body. They had been formed with the connivance of
the officers, but in a short time assumed an attitude of entire
independence of them. There was a distinction between the council of
war and the council of the army: in the former Cromwell had the chief
influence, not in the latter. They imputed to him that he had always
regarded the army merely as a means of attaining his political ends;
that it had been all-important to him to drive away his opponents and
rivals, like Stapleton and Hollis; that after succeeding in this, he
had forgotten the cause of the army and of the people; that he was
seen to sit among the usurpers, and contribute to increase the burdens
of the people; they had honoured him so long as he had gone to work
uprightly, but now he had dealings with the malignants who surrounded
the King, and interested himself on their behalf. Robert Devereux, Earl
of Essex, who to the last had formed a centre for the Presbyterians,
had died in the previous year without issue. The report was spread
abroad, that the King would make Cromwell, for his good services, Earl
of Essex.</p>

<p>On the side of the accusers were some <i>few</i> superior officers,
such as Colonel Rainsborough, who was not wanting in the energy
requisite for leading a party, and Lilburne, who had largely
contributed to the ferment by various pamphlets.</p>

<p>In October the Agitators of five cavalry regiments, among them
Cromwell’s, Ireton’s and Fleetwood’s own regiments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1647.</span> united, and formulated their wishes in two papers—‘The True
Statement of the Cause of the Army’ and ‘Agreement with the People’—in
which their demands were set forth, both for themselves and for the
people, with much fire and emphasis. They did not hesitate to lay
it before the next meeting of the assembly of officers, held at
the head-quarters at Putney. Fairfax was not present, but Cromwell
and Ireton were; and denied that this was the opinion of the army.
Rainsborough asserted the contrary, and called for the punishment of
those who had entered into an understanding with the King. Violent
words followed: the papers themselves were referred to a commission,
which was to report on them.</p>

<p>The council of the army would not hear of any agreement with the King.
A pamphlet was put in circulation, and even brought before the King’s
eyes at Hampton Court, which said that he must be punished personally,
since he had given occasion for so much bloodshed.</p>

<p>Thus there was a division in the armed force which held the power in
its hands. Cromwell, who scarcely was misjudged by his companions
in arms, would have been content for the time, it appears, with the
advantages already gained. What a charm there is in contests like
these, in overthrowing our opponents by parliamentary resolutions, and
bringing over the majority to our side! It might be an object of his
ambition, in the old conflict of the Royalist, Parliamentarian, and
Independent interests, to gain the upper hand for the latter, in union
with the King, whereby the existence of each individual, and also of
society in general, would be secured, with some reforms possibly, but
in the main in its present condition. On the other hand, the majority
of the soldiers represented by the Agitators rejected all further
dealings with the King: God had hardened his heart, or he would have
accepted the proposals made to him: God had put all things under the
feet of the victorious army, and thus laid on it a duty to settle
the country according to their original convictions. The army would
have preferred to abstain from all further dealings with the Long
Parliament: it demanded the formation of a new one on the basis of an
effective representation of the people. It rejected with increasing
vehemence, not only the Presbyterian, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span>
also the Episcopalian system with the modification last proposed, and
claimed an absolute right to universal liberty of conscience, the
abolition of a series of oppressive taxes, a thorough reform of justice
and of the entire public weal. A new political element now emerged from
profound darkness into the light of public life: a conscious advance
was made towards social revolution.</p>

<p>These ideas became at once personally dangerous to the officers, when
the idea was suggested that the army ought to elect its own officers:
this was expressed in a pamphlet of Lilburne’s, which further said
that the army ought to form a council out of the sincere friends of
the people, in order to check the usurpation of the Parliament men.
The ideas of the Agitators were as little consistent with military
subordination, which depends on a relation assumed <i>a priori</i> and
actually subsisting, as with every other aspect of order. It appeared
as though an authority would be created out of the midst of the army,
both to command it and to carry out the desired reforms in the nation.</p>

<p>The officers could not possibly let this continue, as they saw their
own existence threatened: but what means had they of acting in
opposition? The total rejection of the proposals must have caused
an outbreak of complete disobedience. They resolved to resist the
movement, while giving way to it in part. In a detailed remonstrance
against the prevailing insubordination and mutiny, Fairfax declared
that he neither could nor would retain the command of them under such
circumstances. Military obedience is the indispensable condition of the
existence of an army. Would it not have endangered its own internal
coherence, if it had carried out the plan of electing its own officers?
At the same time he made several promises corresponding to the wishes
expressed by the troops, which should be performed when obedience was
restored. There were some regiments which were not satisfied, and
appeared at the places of assembly with tokens of resistance: but
by far the greater part professed themselves content. They signed a
pledge to be satisfied with what the general council of officers should
determine in respect to the army and to the entire kingdom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1647.</span> This example influenced also the malcontents. A court
martial was held in the open field which sentenced to death three of
the chief mutineers, one of whom, selected by lot, was shot in front
of his regiment. In the latter half of November obedience might be
considered as re-established: and Parliament voted its thanks to the
generals who had most contributed to this result.</p>

<p>Just as the extreme tendencies towards a general dissolution of society
came to light among the troops, who had taken up arms of their own free
inclination, and thought that they had acquired by their victories the
right to establish universal autonomy, so also it may be stated that
they were first checked in their course by the necessity of military
discipline, the thing which of all others is furthest removed from all
self-assertion: the troops obeyed their officers, whose commissions
were derived from a totally different order of things from that which
they recognised.</p>

<p>They had not, as has been said, given way unconditionally. The promises
which Fairfax had made, at the moment of the crisis, contemplated a
new Parliament, which should proceed from free and equal elections,
and wherever possible fully represent the people. In the addresses in
which the regiments recognised the general as the chief set over them
by God, they repeated their old demands, security for the rights and
liberties of the realm according to the assurances given to the people.
The officers could not possibly place themselves in direct opposition
to the tendencies prevailing in the army, which after all many of them
privately shared. While the troops submitted to pay the old military
obedience, the officers gave scope to the democratic ideas which had
increased in the army. An understanding was entered into between
the officers and the Agitators, by which the former retained their
authority, but the latter maintained their rights.</p>

<p>The King immediately discovered what this meant. When he saw himself
threatened by the Agitators, at the moment when the contest broke
out, he had taken counsel with the Scottish delegates, who came to
him as friends, as to where he should seek refuge from them, whether
in London, or perhaps at Edinburgh, or somewhere on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1647.</span> Border, say at Berwick, so as to have support against
extreme dangers. But this was not altogether within his own option. In
conformity to his promise he first asked the leaders for permission to
quit Hampton Court. They were doubtless well disposed to grant it, for
they too would not let him fall into the hands of the Agitators<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>.
But how could they have allowed him to go to the capital or to
Scotland, where their chief opponents would have employed his presence
against them! Moreover this was not the King’s intention. He knew that
the Scots would grant him nothing if he fell again into their power,
but might do so if they saw themselves threatened by his connexion with
the army. He expected, if in the then impending contest the officers
gained the upper hand, that they would fulfil the promises made to
him, but that if they did not remain masters, they would seek support
in him, the King<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. Not without political calculation in his own
way, as to the means of deriving advantage from the hostility of
parties, Charles I resolved to fly to the Isle of Wight, where Colonel
Hammond was in command, a man who a short time before had expressed his
displeasure at the wild fury of the soldiers, with whom he would have
nothing more to do. In the evening of November 10, Charles I quitted
Hampton Court in apparent flight. Attended by Ashburnham, Legge, and
Berkeley, he found the gates of the park, through which he issued,
unguarded: he was unpursued on his way through the wood, where he
himself acted as guide: it seems as though a well-considered connivance
of the other side had aided him. From Titchfield, where he stayed in
concealment, he sent word to Hammond of his approach. Hammond could be
induced to give no further promise than that he would treat the King as
might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> expected of a man of honour. Charles
I felt that he was still a prisoner, but at first he was treated with
much distinction. Here also the old respect for the name of King
attended him. As he passed through Newport, a lady came out of a house
to present to the King a rose which at that late season had bloomed in
her garden, and to offer him her good wishes. In Carisbrook castle—one
of the fortresses with which Henry VIII had strengthened the coast
defences—whither Hammond conducted him, he enjoyed tolerable liberty.
No one was at first denied access to him: old friends and servants
flocked round him. The King was still very far from despairing of his
cause. While in the Isle of Wight he added some concessions on single
points to the proposals made at Newcastle, and renewed his request for
personal negotiations in London: but he still held to his resolution
never to assent to the definitive abolition of Episcopacy or to the
sale of Church lands. He still hoped to have in this the support of the
superior officers.</p>

<p>He had however calculated only that they would win the day or be
beaten; it had never occurred to him that they would recover their
superiority as against the Agitators, and then adopt most of their
ideas. The representative whom he sent to them to Windsor was surprised
at the coldness and reserve with which he was received. At the dead of
night, in a lonely place, he had an interview with one of the chief
officers, formerly well disposed to the King, who told him that though
it looked as if they had retained the upper hand, yet in reality it
was not the case. Cromwell had been visited by a large part of the
soldiers, perhaps two thirds of the whole, who had assured him that
they were determined not to recede from their old views, and that if he
opposed them they would make a division in the army and try to destroy
their opponents<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>: that feeling the danger which might hence result
to himself, Cromwell, under the mediation of Hugh Peters, had joined
the violent enthusiasts: that the idea of holding to the King had again
occurred to him, but that he had rejected it, seeing that even in case
of victory the best that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1647.</span> he could expect would
be nothing more than pardon: but that as he could not bring the army
over to his side, he had no resource but to go over to theirs. Cromwell
intimated to the King’s representative that he would serve the King,
so long as it was possible without ruining himself, but that he could
not be expected to perish for his sake<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>. No notice was taken of the
King’s proposals.</p>

<p>Parliament also was destined by the Agitators to destruction, but
for this things were by no means ripe. Their immediate object was to
crush in the bud any agreement with the King, and in this they fully
succeeded. Under the influence of the officers, who in turn depended on
the public opinion formed in the army, four bills passed the Houses in
the middle of December, which were fundamentally at variance with the
King’s views.</p>

<p>Therein Parliament in the first place demanded the entire military
authority, together with the right to impose the taxes necessary for
the maintenance of the army, unconditionally for the next twenty years,
whether the King lived or died: after that period this power might not
be wielded by the crown without the assent of Parliament, but might be
by Parliament without the assent of the crown, for every resolution
passed by the two Houses was to be considered as having the royal
assent<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. The concession which the King offered was temporary and
limited to his own life; the scheme demanded by Parliament would have
made the military power for ever independent of the crown.</p>

<p>Parliament moreover wished to be itself equally independent of the
crown. The King was to create no new peers without the consent of the
two Houses: the nominations made by him since his recovery of the Great
Seal were to be cancelled.</p>

<p>Both Parliament and the army had always been most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1647.</span> apprehensive that acts done in direct opposition to the King’s
commands might some day serve as the occasion of judicial prosecution
against individuals. The demand was now addressed to the King that all
orders and decrees against the acts of Parliament and its adherents
should be declared null and void, and that the judges should be for
ever forbidden to trouble any man in respect of them.</p>

<p>The four bills and the propositions appended to them are the expression
of the preponderance newly gained by the army—a manifesto of the
alliance between the leaders for the time, the generals, and the
Agitators. Not only a change of the constitution was aimed at by them,
but also a legalisation of the régime of force at that moment existing.</p>

<p>In order not to be checked in its proceedings from the side of the
city, where an independent spirit still exhibited itself, Parliament
demanded the right to adjourn at whatever time and to whatever place
it pleased<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>. If it should still come to negotiations with the King
in person, it intended that they should not take place in London. What
could be the object of such a meeting? It was assumed at the time that
the prospect of it was kept open by Parliament merely in order not to
be compelled to make offers side by side with the demands which it
made; also that, in case of his acceptance, it wished to reserve all
further points. But the King could feel no temptation to assent. It had
been remarked, especially by the Scots, that he would thereby burden
himself and his people with the army for ever, and make Parliament
a mere sub-committee of the army<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>. Charles replied in a similar
strain, that he would never deprive himself of his sovereignty,
especially in such a way that his successors, as well as himself,
would be unable to regain it, nor would he hold himself liable for the
oppression which thereby would fall upon his people. He considered
it an unheard-of thing to decide the most important points before
negotiation began, and declared himself resolved to accept no acts
that were offered to him before a personal interview; that neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> dislike to his present position, nor fear of
what might be impending, should ever move him from this determination.
He not only refused the proposals, but rejected altogether the course
adopted by Parliament<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>. Parliament surely must have expected this;
perhaps did expect it. The general impression was that the dominant
party wished to bring about a complete breach with the King, by
presenting the bills to him for simple acceptance or rejection.</p>

<p>Now at last the King found that he had fallen into the hands of a
decidedly hostile power: he was treated in the Isle of Wight altogether
as a prisoner. The tone taken in Parliament was as though he had
committed a crime in rejecting the four bills: there was a talk of
confining him in some inland castle and bringing him to trial. Ireton
intimated that the King was refusing to his people security and
protection, the return for which would be obedience; but the latter
could not be had without the former. Cromwell appears as a man who,
after hesitating a moment, has chosen his side, and advances in the
direction of his party with full vehemence. He now repeated the words
of the Agitators, that God had hardened the King’s heart; that he
could not be conciliated, and that the brave soldiers by whom he had
been defeated and conquered must not be exposed to his vengeance: that
Parliament must expect nothing more from him, but should govern by its
own power and resolution.</p>

<p>Parliament now in fact decided on this course: it resolved henceforth
to send no addresses to the King, and to receive no messages or letters
from him: to send any communication to him or receive any from him
without the leave of Parliament was to be high treason (Jan. 3). The
King was virtually excluded from his kingdom.</p>

<p>The general assembly of the army accepted these declarations with joy.
It asserted that Parliament could have asked for nothing less than
was contained in the last proposals, without endangering the safety
of itself and of all who adhered to it, without deserting the cause
for which God had declared in the result of the battles. It assented
without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> opposition to the resolutions now
passed, and promised to defend them against all.</p>

<p>The fact that the superior officers who sat in Parliament exhibited
not only no leaning towards the King, but the harshest aversion to his
cause, completely put an end to the misunderstanding between them and
the common soldiers. At Windsor, where the General Assembly met, the
restoration of unity was celebrated by a festival. Deputies went to the
various garrisons, in order to give an account everywhere of the new
turn of events, which the soldiers regarded as the triumph of their
opinions, and to arouse corresponding sentiments. Seven of them, with a
number of officers, laid the declaration of the army before Parliament,
which voted them its thanks. Thus all variance between the army and its
officers, and between the army and Parliament, was removed; and at this
moment they all made common cause against the King.</p>

<p>In their first zeal they had intended to pass formal ordinances against
the King’s authority; but this was as yet avoided, the more so as no
special constitutional forms were needed to carry on the government of
the country without reference to him. It sufficed to do as was done
by a resolution of January 3, namely, to renew in relation to England
and Ireland, without reference to the Scottish members, the authority
possessed by the Committee of the two kingdoms: the only thing
needed was to replace by some Independents the excluded Presbyterian
members. The twenty-one members of whom it was composed, seven lords
and fourteen commoners, thus took into their hands the supreme power.
Among the latter we find the two Vanes, Haslerig, and Cromwell.
Northumberland, Warwick, and other Presbyterian lords fought for some
time against agreeing to this: the King’s friends expected a breach
between the two Houses; but on January 15 the Lords also assented to
the resolution of the Lower House.</p>

<p>What then immediately came to light was the domination of the men
who had obtained the lead in the Parliamentary struggles, and who
were popularly named Grandees. Each of these ruled absolutely over a
faction: whoever did not join the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> factions
fell at once to the ground. The most weighty affairs were arranged
beforehand in the Committees by a few persons, and then came before
the Lower House. But it was asserted that all the parts were settled
beforehand, who should make the proposal, support it, deal with this or
that part of the question, and close the debate. A most extraordinary
position was enjoyed by those who managed money matters. Great sums
were raised by loan; an important part, some said half, of the
property in the kingdom was in sequestration, monthly contributions
were collected, the excise brought in a considerable revenue: but the
millions which came in, in money or money’s worth, passed through so
many hands, that it was impossible to keep account of it all: the old
arrangements of the Exchequer no longer existed.</p>

<p>Thus, under the forms of a Parliament, which was meant to represent
the rights of the nation, some few had possessed themselves of all
authority, and constituted, as was said at the time, an oligarchy with
dictatorial power<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>. And woe to any one who should rise against
them. The Grandees desired nothing better than a manifestation made by
their opponents, so as to be able to throw them into prison and seize
their property. Everywhere there were, or were supposed to be, spies:
the informers received a portion of the fines.</p>

<p>A committee, already appointed to suppress distasteful pamphlets,
was now furnished with new and strict instructions, and rewards were
offered to those who should denounce the secret presses and anonymous
authors<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>. The drama was entirely forbidden; and stage, galleries,
and benches removed from the theatres. If a case occurred, the players
were to be punished as vagabonds, and the spectators subjected to a
fine.</p>

<p>Fairfax had sent two regiments to Whitehall; for in the contest with
the King the Parliamentary and military leaders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span>
were now most closely united. The soldiers exercised a sort of police
authority, and prosecuted malignants and Papists: but what might not
be included under those names! The prisons were filled with Royalists,
alike Catholic and Protestant: others were banished or took to flight.</p>

<p>Thus those who desired to introduce universal liberty appeared as the
wielders of an absolute, selfish, and oppressive power. Ideas in their
nature mutually exclusive were brought, through love of faction and
power, to walk hand in hand.</p>

<span class="small">THE SO-CALLED SECOND CIVIL WAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We have not lost sight of the chief disputes which had caused the
breach between the King and Parliament, concerning which, as the
King did not give way, nothing had been decided by all these acts of
violence. The positive character of the opposition now coming to light,
and the evident usurpation by the oligarchy in Parliament, operated
instead to give the King’s name once more a footing with the people.
The contest hitherto had been waged against the lawfulness and extent
of the royal authority: but in the encounter of selfish factions men
began to discover that a chief power, supreme but not unlimited,
not directly dependent on a change in the majority, and personally
comprising all general interests, was politically an advantage. The
King had innumerable adherents in the capital: there was not a county
in which associations in his favour, as the phrase was, ‘for the
liberation of the King and Parliament,’ had not been formed. Though
the Royalists also were busy, the movement derived its character
chiefly from the fact that the Presbyterians found the turn which
affairs had taken, and the predominance of their hated opponents, quite
unendurable. The Commissioners of the Scots, who saw themselves no
longer admitted to any committees, and their despatches and memorials,
as well as the terms of the last treaty of union, unnoticed, were
most excited of all. They already noted the intention to exclude
their countrymen from Ireland: it was obvious that the victory of
the Independents was a defeat for the Presbyterians in general, and
especially for the Scots.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances what the King had expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1648.</span> came to pass. The Scottish Commissioners gave up imposing on
him the strict law of the Covenant in respect to religion. Before he
had been subjected to all the restraints which made him completely
a prisoner, they had appeared in the Isle of Wight, and concluded a
secret treaty, based on the proposals formerly made by him in his
Newcastle answer, and then so stubbornly rejected by the Scots. The
King therein undertook to recognise the League and Covenant between
England and Scotland; for the maintenance of the position hereby
accorded to the Scots was the chief aim of the Commissioners. He had
also to admit several other limitations, which related to old disputes
between the two countries, and favoured exclusively the Scottish
interest; but the principal point for him was that he was not compelled
unconditionally to accept the Presbyterian Church system. As he had
proposed, it was only to be temporarily adopted, for a period of three
years, and the permanent arrangement to be reserved for subsequent
determination in Parliament: no one was to be compelled to accept
the Covenant. The Scots, on their side, promised to take up arms, if
it could not be secured in any other way, for the prerogative of the
crown, understanding thereby its rights in relation to the military
power, free nomination to dignities and high posts of trust, control
of the Great Seal, a veto on Parliament: the present assembly to
be brought to an end speedily, and personal dealings with a full
Parliament, in honour, safety, and freedom, to be procured for the
King<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>. It is noteworthy that they guaranteed to the King the very
rights which were denied him in the four bills: they contemplated the
union of the two kingdoms on a basis much more advantageous for the
crown. The three commissioners, Loudon, Lauderdale, and Lanerick,
pledged themselves to do all in their power to get Scotland to carry
out the points here promised, which, in their view, would be done: and
to risk their property and even their lives for the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span>

<p>It was an arrangement very like that which Charles I and his Scottish
friends had contemplated in 1641, before his journey to Scotland,
and again in 1644, at the time of the Uxbridge negotiations: the
concessions which the Scottish commissioners then refused they now
decided to admit, in prospect of the danger threatening them from the
opposite party: for the restoration of a monarchy, limited indeed, but
endowed with suitable rights in connexion with the national interests
of Scotland, they were now ready to involve their native land in war.</p>

<p>Lord Holland was concerned this time also, since the agreement was
on the principles for which he had contended for several years:
he received from the Queen, in the name of the Prince of Wales, a
commission as general of an army which was to liberate the King from
his imprisonment, and restore the freedom of Parliament. Many old
officers of the royal army gathered about him. The young Duke of
Buckingham and the Earl of Peterborough, with their brothers, were
ready to stake their lives and fortunes in the cause. The Scottish
commission was in close communication with Marmaduke Langdale and
Philip Musgrave, who enjoyed great influence, the one in Yorkshire, the
other in Cumberland: they too received in the name of the Prince of
Wales royal commissions with very extensive powers.</p>

<p>The main question was then whether the Scottish Parliament would
sanction the proceedings of the commissioners and give its consent
to the war. In the Church commission, which was as little as ever
inclined to give up the unconditional establishment of the Covenant
in England, it found no approval: on the contrary, the King’s
promises were declared unsatisfactory, because his preference for
Episcopacy and his dislike to the Covenant were everywhere visible in
them. But the Church commission had now to learn that the nation no
longer depended entirely upon it. The general feeling was that the
agreement so solemnly made had been broken on the side of England:
they were ashamed of the surrender of the King, which had given the
nation an evil name throughout the world: the growing strength of the
Independents left nothing to be expected but an increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1648.</span> disregard of Scottish interests. In many places also a
natural sympathy was awakened for their hereditary King. Thus it came
to pass that the elections to the new Parliament went in favour of the
agreement effected with the King. The leaders of the rival parties were
Argyle, who now as ever held to the strict Church view, and Hamilton,
who represented the moderates: this time Hamilton and his friends
gained a complete superiority over Argyle. The committees also of the
Parliament, which met in March, were chosen in the same interest. They
had still a hard battle to fight with the Church commission, which
still maintained that the King must be bound by oath to establish the
Presbyterian system in all the three kingdoms, and that the repression
of the malignants in England ought to be aimed at, not alliance with
them<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>. It is remarkable that the threatened supremacy of the
Independents did not more strongly arouse the religious apprehensions
of the Church party: but their view was limited by old antipathies that
were directed to other quarters. But the committees, the Parliament,
and the people, comprehended the full danger that threatened the
Commonwealth, and approved the agreement with the King. In conformity
with their decisions some very precise demands were at once addressed
to England. They were to the effect that the King should be allowed
to treat with Parliament in freedom, safety, and honour, and that
for this purpose, in order that it might be possible for all honest
members of Parliament to take part without danger in these dealings,
the army under Lord Fairfax should be disbanded. It is obvious that
an affirmative answer was not to be thought of, nor was any such
expected in Scotland. At the same time a resolution had been passed
for assuming an attitude of defence and preparing for war; and this
was done immediately throughout the country<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>. Hamilton, thanks
to the activity of his party, was enabled to take more decided steps
than properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> suited his hesitating nature: he
received the chief command. The most celebrated of the old generals,
such as the Lesleys, adhered to Argyle; but Hamilton gained others,
like Middleton, who had lately made himself a reputation in the
Highlands: he was named Lieutenant-General of the infantry, Baillie
of the cavalry: the highest post under Hamilton was accepted by the
Earl of Callander, who after the Pacification of Berwick had espoused
the royal interests. In this manner were the officers named and levies
raised: the dependents of Argyle remained virtually excluded from the
new army; the Church party resisted vainly at every step. It was the
first time that Royalist proclivities gained an advantage over the
strict Church tendencies. Under the impulse of the latter the Scots had
contributed most towards breaking the independent power of the King:
now the moderates had again the advantage, and it seemed as if this
would lead to a restoration of his power.</p>

<p>Marmaduke Langdale commenced hostilities by surprising Berwick (end
of April): he hoped from thence to rouse the north of England. He at
once summoned the governor of Holy Island, who was reported to dislike
the imprisonment of the King and the violation of all the laws by
Parliament<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>, and the Royalist gentry of Northumberland and Durham
to declare for the King: many of them actually came over and entered
the King’s service. In like manner Philip Musgrave one evening seized
Carlisle: he was expected by the Royalists, and the other side did
not venture to move. All Westmoreland and Cumberland were filled with
warlike bustle: out of Yorkshire and the County Palatine came new
levies of horse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Byron had occupied Anglesey, from whence he roused his
old friends in Cheshire and North Wales to resistance against the
Parliament. In South Wales Colonel Poyer held Pembroke Castle: he
refused at the command of Parliament to surrender his strong castle
to the general, whom he designated King Fairfax, saying that he would
maintain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> cause of the true King against
him: he raised the red war-standard and summoned the neighbouring
<i>gentry to</i> take up arms. Many promised him their help. Petitions
in favour of the King and of the Book of Common Prayer were put in
circulation. It is asserted that in Cornwall nearly 4000 men assembled
under the King’s banner. The troops wore blue and white ribbons in
their hats, with the inscription ‘We wish to see our King.’</p>

<p>The movement seized also in a remarkable manner on the fleet which lay
in the Downs. The desertion of the fleet had chiefly occasioned the
misfortunes of Charles I, and the Presbyterian sentiments, which then
had struck the first blow, had always prevailed among the sailors;
but these now operated in favour of the King. The fleet also desired
personal communication for the King, the observance of the old laws
of the land, above all the dissolution of the Independent army. The
attempt to force on them, as vice-admiral, Colonel Rainsborough, a
member of the army of the most decided type, who had now made his peace
with Cromwell, caused the outbreak of an actual revolt. A number of
ships quitted the Downs to sail over to Holland, whither the young Duke
of York had lately succeeded in escaping. The leaders were presented to
him at Helvoetsluys, and implored him to be their admiral. In a short
time however the Prince of Wales arrived in the Netherlands, and took
the chief command, for which he was in years more capable: we find him
soon afterwards cruising on the English coasts with the vessels that
had gone over, but without any marked success.</p>

<p>The cry of the sailors was almost universal in England. Without giving
way to the special tendencies of the Scots, the people demanded the
observance of the laws, according to which free-born Englishmen were
accustomed to be governed, and leave to the King for free personal
communication.</p>

<p>When the alliance of the opposite powers, to which the Royalists had
succumbed, fell to pieces, all their hopes again revived. Everywhere
the old Cavaliers rose. In one of their pamphlets it is said that the
black cloud was parting which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> hitherto had
hung over them; that their fortune was rising again from the lowest
ebb; that the bravery of the North was uniting with the spirit of the
South; and that on Hounslow, Dunsmore, Blackheath, on all heaths and
heights men were gathering at the call of honour. Now they would have
the citizens on their side, who, no longer poisoned by city air, were
resolved to die on the bed of honour for the prerogative of their
King, which implied the liberty of his subjects. Who could see with
dry eyes the indignities which the King had to endure? He would long
ago have succumbed to machinations and conspiracies, had not the hand
of God rescued him. The undaunted Cavalier would seek for peace sword
in hand, but would also exact retribution for past crimes. Were there
not nobles who had been murdered, had seen their daughters carried off,
their homes plundered, because they wished to defend their houses<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>?
In an unexpected and singular manner the complaints of the cities
corresponded with the views of the Cavaliers. In London it was said
that the capital had done most towards carrying on the war, and that
the army might well be content with what the city had done; but yet it
wanted to exact its arrears from the city, and oppressed it cruelly.</p>

<p>Hitherto the relations between the King and Parliament had been the
only point debated; the rights of the people had been included in those
of Parliament. Now however that an authority had been formed which
oppressed at once King, Parliament, and people, the popular antipathy
was directed against it. The feeling now began to gain ground that the
rights of the crown form a part of the public freedom.</p>

<p>It was declared that the King and the country were in the same case,
both injured and abused in their rights; that the prerogative of
the King and the liberty of the country were most closely connected
with one another; and that there was no hope of restoring the latter
before the King sat again on his throne<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>. The holders of power
were designated in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> style of the times as
ambitious Absaloms who were become haughty Rehoboams. The only means of
resistance to them lay in the union of all loyal men in order to work
with all their might for the restoration of the King. The Londoners
were heard to say that they would spend as much more to restore the
King and avenge themselves on their oppressors.</p>

<p>The prevailing party sought to check this inclination by a detailed
statement of the King’s transgressions in the style of the old
Remonstrance, and this time also avoided laying it before the Lords:
it was merely the work of the Lower House, which had many debates over
it, for the imputations raised did not seem to all to be well founded.
A minority, considerable under the circumstances (fifty votes against
eighty), declared against it at the last division: but to the majority
the declaration appeared necessary in order to explain to some extent,
as well as to strengthen, the proceedings taken against the King. The
accusations were directed no longer, as formerly, against his bad
advisers, but against himself, and a readiness was evinced to carry on
the government without further reference to him<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>. This time however
the declaration produced an effect contrary to what was intended,
being without the religious impulse which had given its effect to
the first, and being intended less to destroy a government that had
grown hateful, than to pave the way for a new one that already excited
disapproval. Most men considered that Parliament, in undertaking to
govern without the King who had summoned it, was committing a flagrant
usurpation. Declarations which were secretly put in circulation in the
King’s name found general favour. Parliament confiscated and burned
the copies which fell into its hands, but they were nevertheless
spread abroad in the city, in the country, and even in the army: the
pains which Parliament took to discover their origin gave them all the
greater weight, as leading to the conclusion that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1648.</span> really proceeded from the King<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>. The reports of the
movements in Scotland gave the liveliest satisfaction both in the
capital and in the provinces: the conduct of the rulers in England
in entering into negotiations with the Scots, and sparing nothing to
win over their leaders, was due to their fear less of the strength of
the Scots than of their influence over England<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>, or perhaps both
motives were combined. Had they not been afraid of the Scots they would
have entirely disarmed the city and dispersed the Common Council.
At the same time apprehension of a rising in the city deterred them
from encountering the Scots with the vigour which would otherwise
have characterised their views and actions<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>. Effects of this
feeling were conspicuous in Parliament even under present conditions.
The leaders expected to find themselves in a position to carry into
execution one of the demands contained in their four bills, namely to
prorogue Parliament and intrust the exercise of the supreme authority
to a committee in its stead<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>. They abstained from so doing because
it might easily have caused an open insurrection. Mazarin said that the
King ought to be thankful to his enemies for having rejected conditions
which would have been most burdensome to the crown, and for having
issued offensive manifestos against him, for that public opinion had
been thereby won over to his side.</p>

<p>A tumult was caused in London about this time (April 6/16) by the
apprentices who would not be debarred their Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1648.</span> amusements outside the gates, and held their ground against
the attack of the militia, and even of some detachments of regular
troops, so that for a moment they were masters of the city: but no
great consequences resulted, as they were without leaders, and were put
down the next day without difficulty: but they had given cheers for the
King, and exhibited the dislike of the populace to the existing order
of things. It was said in the city that the leaders of the army and
their adherents in Parliament had succeeded in alienating Parliament
and the citizens from each other: an honourable man might be deceived
once, but not a second time: and now they were seeking to separate them
from their best friends, the Scots, but that should not be done: that
these Grandees were a worse faction than ever the Spanish had been, and
that reconciliation with them would mean ruin of religion and law<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>.
Cromwell is said to have declared that the city must either be brought
to better obedience or laid in the dust.</p>

<p>Gradually,—for between the opinions of a capital and those of an
assembly sitting in it there operate unavoidably mutual influences of
very various kinds,—at the end of April or beginning of May, a most
extensive change in the sentiments of Parliament was observed. The
Presbyterians regained the preponderance: the Independents either gave
way for the moment, or were in the minority. Resolutions for increasing
the power of the military commanders, which had passed the Lords, were
rejected in the Lower House. The city was restored to full control
over its militia, and allowed to name the governor of the Tower, and
the duty of guarding the Parliament was again intrusted to it. The
troops of Fairfax quitted the posts, of which they had taken possession
during the tumult in the previous year, and the aldermen who had been
imprisoned in consequence were again set free<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>.</p>

<p>Still more significant was the revocation of the decree made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> at the beginning of the year about the King
and the government. It was resolved by a considerable majority—for
the moderates who had retired had now returned—that the constitution
of England, according to which King, Lords, and Commons co-operated
in the government, should not be altered, and that without regard to
the divisions of January 3, the proposals made to the King before his
flight to the Isle of Wight should be repeated, and negotiations opened
with him about them<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>. On May 19 Parliament sent a deputation to
the Common Council, to inform the city of these resolutions, and to
begin the restoration of the old relations of mutual confidence and
co-operation. The Common Council answered that these overtures were
like a beam of light breaking through the clouds, and that the city
would live and die with Parliament for the maintenance of the League
and Covenant. But it was no longer the old idea of the League and
Covenant on strict Church principles, in which the city and Parliament
united: they agreed unhesitatingly with the adherents of Hamilton, who
were now supreme in Scotland, in accepting the King’s last proposals as
the basis of a future understanding: and the city also required that he
should be allowed to deal personally with Parliament, and that the army
should be disbanded.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it would have been of the highest importance
to have rescued the King from custody, and to have placed him in the
midst of his adherents; and two attempts were made, one soon after the
other, to effect this. They were contrived by the society to which Lady
Carlisle belonged, and chiefly by the ladies<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>. Once some soldiers
on guard had been actually won, and a boat provided to carry the King
away to a safe place; but at the critical moment everything was spoiled
by unexpected difficulties, or by the watchfulness of his enemies.</p>

<p>The contradiction was most startling: while Parliament was thinking of
reconciliation with the King and dismissal of the army, the latter was
actually waging war in the name of Parliament against all supporters of
these views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span>

<p>At the beginning of May Cromwell set out with a strong division against
the Royalists of South Wales. Some resistance was offered by the feudal
castle of Chepstow, which seems to dominate its neighbourhood as
though it had grown up out of the ground. While this place, and with
it a number of men influential in the country, was being reduced by a
subordinate, Cromwell himself moved forward to besiege Pembroke, which
was defended with all the more stubbornness, because the chiefs who
were shut up there could reckon on no mercy. It capitulated on July 11,
but a number of exceptions was made in granting terms to the garrison.
Cromwell was less inexorable against the old Royalists than against
those who had once borne arms against the King, for the latter were
guilty of apostasy from God’s light. Three of them were condemned to
death, but were allowed to draw lots which should be executed<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fairfax had been operating to clear the ground in the
neighbourhood of the capital. In connexion with the agitation within
the city and the removal of part of the army from its vicinity,
a movement hostile to the Independents broke out in Kent, which
also demanded primarily the dissolution of the army. With all the
greater fury consequently the divisions, which were collected, dashed
upon the armed crowd which appeared in the field. One of the most
murderous conflicts of the whole war took place at Maidstone<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. The
streets were barricaded, the open square defended with cannon, and a
musketry fire kept up from the houses. It was late at night when the
Independents at last became masters of the town; as they said, by the
help of God, who fought all their battles for them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lord Holland, who this time actually took up arms for the
Presbyterian cause, the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Francis Villiers,
appeared with a considerable body of cavalry at Kingston-on-Thames,
in the hope that Surrey, Sussex, and Middlesex would join them: they
announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> their intention to bring the King
back to Parliament, and to enforce again the recognised laws of the
land. But they did not know the activity of the watchful enemy to
whom they were opposed. Before any one had declared for them their
cavalry was scattered, and the youthful Lord Francis died of the wounds
he received in this encounter: on his body was found a lock of his
lady-love’s hair. On the other hand, the members of the same party who
had risen in Essex, being strengthened by the fugitives from Kent, made
a determined defence at Colchester, which could not be overcome by
the extremity of want: and everywhere it was seen that the disasters
sustained in no way checked the agitation.</p>

<p>It was mainly this state of things which induced the Scots to advance
into England before their preparations were completed or their
opponents at home pacified<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>: otherwise the friends upon whom they
might reckon for the present would be altogether put down. The opinion
even of those who did not wish it was that this undertaking would
probably succeed, that the Parliament would send Cromwell to Wales, and
Fairfax to Colchester, so as to leave free scope for the Scottish army,
and that so the sectarian force might easily be dissipated. It would
be a good thing no doubt that the King should be restored, but not by
these hands and with such evil allies: this would endanger the glorious
Reformation for which Scotland had endured so much<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>.</p>

<p>We may see what at this moment was still possible. A fresh battle must
decide between the moderate Presbyterians and the Independents: but how
much depended on its issue? By the victory of the former a monarchy,
limited indeed, but still free, and with it the continuation of all
legally existing arrangements, would have been saved, and a prospect
opened of the restoration of the Episcopal Church within definite
limits; the victory of the second could lead to nothing but a republic,
and rendered probable a breach with the past in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1648.</span> the form either of a completely effected and radical revolution
on the basis of the rights of the individual, or of the domination
of the army and its leaders. Moreover, if the Scots gained the day,
there was no need, in the existing state of parties and considering
the greater moderation of that which was now supreme, to apprehend the
maintenance of that political and religious preponderance at which they
had hitherto aimed, though they would not have allowed themselves to
be forced back into a subordinate position: a relation of equilibrium
between the two countries would have been formed. On the other hand,
the victory of the Independents might be expected to cause not only
their entire supremacy in England, but also the extension of it over
Scotland, and consequently the establishment, at any rate within a
short time, of the undoubted preponderance of England in Great Britain.
The relations of the European states were such that none of them could
interfere decisively at this moment. The French had never yet succeeded
in concluding a general peace, the Spaniards especially showing an
unyielding obstinacy. There was even a talk of an attack on France to
be made in concert by them and the Independents, which in the summer
of 1648, when the troubles of the Fronde broke out, might have been
very destructive. On this ground the French avoided everything which
might have roused the Independents against France, and have caused an
alliance between them and Spain. The assistance given by the French to
the King’s cause was but indirect and slight, very far removed from
the persistent help which two years before they had led him to expect.
A stronger support was afforded by Charles I’s son-in-law, William II
Prince of Orange, who had now become Stadtholder-General: but he was
hampered at every step by constitutional opposition, which limited his
participation. In the midst of the existing divisions of Europe these
contests were more than ever purely British—between the nationalities,
or rather between the religious and political ideas which pervaded
them; and now by the advance of the Scots into England, they were
brought to a decisive conflict.</p>

<p>Hamilton appeared in England with pomp greater than befitted even his
high rank, surrounded by a splendid bodyguard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span> <span class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1648.</span> and attended by a numerous train of nobles. His cavalry was
perhaps the best that ever crossed the Scottish frontier, but his
infantry was ill-trained, armed more with pikes than muskets, and not
sufficiently familiar with the use of them. Although he had formerly
served under or beside Gustavus Adolphus, he could not be reckoned
a thorough soldier, nor had he the enthusiasm of a ruling idea: his
sympathy with the Royalist cause was always influenced by his own
personal position and by the circumstances of the moment. His strategy
bore the same character. Of the generals who surrounded him, those
who knew most about war, such as Middleton and Colonel Turner, who
filled the office of Adjutant-General, would have preferred to direct
their advance into Yorkshire by the route previously adopted, since
the inhabitants there were again more favourably disposed to the
Scots, and the cavalry would have had more room to act on the open
moorlands: but Hamilton wished first to relieve Carlisle, for which
reason they deviated from this course; and when at Hornby, after
a considerable advance, the proposal to turn in the direction of
Yorkshire was discussed, Hamilton rejected it, because he expected to
find a favourable reception in Manchester, and after that to be able
to rekindle the flame of insurrection not yet quite extinct in North
Wales. This political motive prevailed over military considerations:
Hamilton was wont in most cases to give way readily, but on this one
point he held firm. In the army too the conviction prevailed that they
should find friends everywhere, and with their help would soon reach
London. They fancied themselves engaged in a peaceful occupation,
rather than in a dangerous campaign. The separate divisions proceeded
on their way far apart from each other, without dreading an enemy.
Cromwell came upon them in this state. His troops were of sorry
appearance, for they had already suffered severely in Wales, and even
when united with the division of Lambert, who came from the North to
join them, were by no means equal in number to the enemy; but they
felt the full impulse of their religious and political principle, and
were fighting for their existence. If Hamilton gained a firm position
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> England, so that their opponents might
be able to rally to him, they were lost. If they conquered him, all
Britain was in their hands. Though weaker in total numbers, Cromwell
and Lambert were the stronger at every single point where, three days
in succession, they encountered the enemy. On the first day they had
a very obstinate fight with the English Royalists under Marmaduke
Langdale<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>, who being ill supported by the main army and ultimately
outflanked, retired upon Preston. The town itself could not be held
against Cromwell’s cavalry, nor the bridge over the Ribble against
his musketeers. The Scots did not allow themselves to be turned by
this disaster from their line of march upon Wigan and Warrington. In
the council of war held on horseback on the open field, the opinion
was given that they ought to hold their ground where they were and
await attack; but considering the want of provisions and the continued
absence of several regiments, it seemed more advisable to continue
their march. The unceasing rainy weather, the roads that gave no
footing in that deep and boggy country, especially on Wigan Moor, made
progress extremely difficult. On this second day the Independents
had the advantage of being able to attack in rear the Scottish rear
guard, and inflicted serious losses upon it. On the third day Cromwell
overtook the advancing force at the pass of Winwick. Here once more a
regular battle took place. The Scots and Royalists defended themselves
most bravely; once the Independents were forced to give way, but at
last they obtained the victory. When the Scots reached Warrington, they
found that, in spite of the strong position they had taken up, they
were no longer able to cope with the enemy. The long march of two days
and two nights without sufficient food had exhausted the strength of
the men, they had no ammunition, they had lost all their artillery, and
the population around was hostile. In this desperate situation Hamilton
was urged to let the infantry capitulate, and escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1648.</span> himself with the cavalry. It seems that he never formally gave
his consent, but the soldiers, the officers, and the other generals
were unanimous in favour of this course, and the entire body of
infantry surrendered as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The cavalry fared no better a few days later. After some days’ march
Hamilton despaired of breaking through with them, and on August 25 he
surrendered to Major-General Lambert, to whom Cromwell had intrusted
the pursuit<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>. Those about the King tried to comfort him by saying
that Hamilton had intended to mount the throne himself. He answered
that a wave of his hand would have put an end to such a project; he
regarded this defeat as the greatest disaster which could happen to him.</p>

<p>At each stage of these civil wars it was always a great pitched battle
which was decisive. As at Marston Moor, all danger to the power of
Parliament from the co-operation of the Scots and English Royalists was
removed, and at Naseby the monarchy was completely overthrown by the
Independents, without the help, nay, even in opposition to the Scots,
so now at Preston the influence of the Scots and their ideas upon the
Church and realm of England was terminated.</p>

<p>It was very hard on the Presbyterian preachers to be obliged at the
order of the government to celebrate this victory in the churches.
Most of them contented themselves with merely reading the news and the
order; others expressed their astonishment, one might have said their
indignation, that God should let the righteous cause be defeated and
favour the unrighteous: they added that the sword of Cromwell was after
all the sword of God, for he was God’s scourge for the earth.</p>

<p>In the South of England all was decided by this event: Colchester
surrendered; the Prince quitted the Downs; and the fleet exhibited a
change of sentiments. In the North Cromwell pressed on the remainder
of the defeated army. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> was commanded by
Parliament to let no new war arise out of the ashes of the old one;
to follow up his victory until he had completed it, and above all,
until he had retaken Berwick and Carlisle. He was not empowered to
enter Scotland, but he had already such a position that he could
venture to proceed to invasion on his own account if the necessity of
the case seemed to require it. When he crossed the Tweed he requested
the Committee of the Scottish Estates to deliver up to him the two
fortresses, or else he should appeal to God; that is to say, to the
decision of war.</p>

<p>There were still some remains of the defeated army in the field: Sir
George Monro had come into Scotland with the troops that had arrived
from Ireland a short time before the defeat, and had there been
reinforced by new levies: and as yet Hamilton’s adherents did not give
up the contest. Lanerick, the Duke’s brother, thought it possible to
defend the frontiers, and perhaps next year to undertake something
in the King’s favour. But a contrary movement broke out in Scotland
itself. The Church had regarded the defeat of Hamilton, which took
place on the anniversary of the Covenant, as the actual judgment of
God. Beside the political dissentients there arose also the clergy at
the head of their parishioners, and they drove the Committee of Estates
from Edinburgh. From this rising, the Whiggamores’ raid<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> as it was
called, the name of Whigs was derived. Nor was it unimportant; it made
the resistance of the remains of the Royalists to Cromwell’s invasion
impossible, and thereby contributed materially to the decision of the
great question.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as though the two parties would come to blows,
but neither felt itself strong and determined enough for this. The
adherents of Hamilton allowed the management of affairs to be taken in
hand by their opponents, who professed to be friends of Cromwell, and
greeted his victory as their own.</p>

<p>On October 4, 1648, Cromwell entered Edinburgh. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span> <span class="sidenote">
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1648.</span> leader of the Independents was received as if
in triumph by the leaders of the Covenanters, who at an earlier time
had seen in him their most dangerous and detested enemy. At his first
appearance on Scottish soil Carlisle and Berwick had been given up.
He now gave it to be understood that as all the confusion of the last
few months had been caused by Scotland not crushing the malignants
and authors of the troubles, but conferring on them confidential
posts of rank and importance, he must take precautions, in the name
of the English Parliament, against this ever happening in future.
The Committee of Estates as now constituted saw its own interest in
excluding his enemies. It promised the next day to take care that no
one who had had a share in the last alliance, or had been in arms,
should hold any public office without the consent of England. In the
next Parliament followed the infamous law fixing the classes according
to which this exclusion was regulated in a graduated scale.</p>

<p>The French observed that it was all over with the independence of
Scotland, to which they attached so much importance<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>. But the
immediate result was merely that Argyle, Johnston, and their party,
resumed the dominant position which they had recently lost.</p>

<p>The strict Presbyterians and the Independents had this at least in
common, that both were inconsistent with that theory of the monarchy to
which Charles I still adhered. Through their co-operation the moderate
Presbyterianism, which in any case could and would work with him, had
been overthrown in both England and Scotland; but they were by no means
agreed between themselves.</p>

<span class="small">FALL OF THE KING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While the fate of Charles I was being staked on the dubious issue
of battle, he remained in strict custody in Carisbrook castle. His
imprisonments had all in some sense been voluntary: he had fled for
refuge to the Scots, and not unwillingly had followed the English
commissioners to Holmby, and the cornet of Cromwell’s army to Hampton
Court: in a kind of flight before the Agitators he repaired to the
Isle of Wight. At every change he conceived new hopes; during every
imprisonment he was busy with open negotiations or secret dealings
of the very widest import. Still he had many quiet hours of profound
retirement. Among the books which he then read are mentioned, first of
all the Bible with commentaries on it, Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity,
the historical plays of Shakespeare, Tasso’s Gierusalemme—nothing
actually historical, for his spirit inclined less to facts than to the
ideal and to theory. He loved to think, and write, and pray alone.
Of the state of mind in which he was evidence is afforded by the
little book ‘Suspiria Regalia,’ as it was originally called, or ‘Eikon
Basilike,’ as it was afterwards named, a collection of prayers and
self-examinations, which were put into the form of a book by another
hand<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>, but contained much that was actually of his own composition.
They agree in places word for word with what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span>
are known to have been his expressions through sources revealed at a
much later date. The earlier portions contain much that is spurious,
and was thought of afterwards; but the later ones, in which opposition
to the Presbyterians is the main topic, and their claims to exclusive
dominion in the kingdom are contested, possess historical value. These
may very likely belong to the times of this imprisonment. They express
throughout Charles I’s resolution not to let himself be degraded to
the position of a king who may follow neither his reason nor his
conscience: he believes himself to merit more gratitude from the
people of England by the resistance he is now offering, than by the
concessions which he had formerly allowed to be extorted. In the Isle
of Wight he was at first, as we saw, treated with much consideration:
he was permitted to send for the furniture to which he was accustomed
from Hampton Court to Carisbrook castle: the governor attended him out
hunting, or he could ride about the island alone. After the refusal of
the four bills this ceased. He was no longer allowed the comfort of
talking on religious topics with his usual chaplains; his confidential
servants were removed; he was confined within the fortifications: every
day brought him some new annoyance such as a prisoner has to endure.
The unsuccessful attempts at escape increased the severity of the
surveillance and seclusion.</p>

<p>Once a great prospect was opened to him while in the Isle of Wight.
During the agitation of the year 1648 caused by the Scottish invasion,
the moderate party in Parliament had carried the proposal to proceed
to new dealings with the King without regard to previous resolutions
to the contrary. Although the Scots had since been defeated, the
matter nevertheless had its legal result, without opposition from the
Independents, who indeed used very magnanimous language<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>. At the
King’s suggestion Newport was selected for the conferences, and in
the middle of September the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> commissioners of
Parliament arrived. A house was found in the little place, suitable
for the King’s abode and for the conferences; and on Monday, September
18, they were opened with the ancient ceremonial. The chaplains,
now allowed to return to the King, stood behind his throne: at some
distance from him the commissioners took their seats, five lords with
Northumberland at their head, and nine members of the Lower House,
including Henry Vane, probably the only one of them all who did not
wish for peace, and Denzil Hollis<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>.</p>

<p>The King’s advantage lay in the fact that the commissioners withdrew
the four bills, and announced terms very nearly corresponding to those
which the Scots had set forth, but more advantageous, inasmuch as there
was no longer any need to take notice of the special wishes of the
Scots.</p>

<p>It is true that the King was very reluctant to believe in any real
result of these negotiations: he would not allow anything to be
intermitted on account of them which could be attempted elsewhere in
defence of his cause: he himself once excused the concessions to which
he agreed, on the ground that they would lead to nothing. The old
duplicity of his policy did not quit him in these moments of a serious,
if not dangerous position. Still it is worth while to note the points
in which the two parties approached an understanding: had there once
been an end to vacillation, or had an agreement been concluded, the
King would have held firmly to it, and would have been kept to it by
the other side.</p>

<p>The first point discussed related to the security of Parliament
itself: it required the revocation of all declarations, accusations,
and judgments issued against its proceedings, or against individual
members. The King, who had always himself demanded an amnesty, raised
no objection to this: he took offence at the introductory words, which
stated that the Parliament had been compelled to take up arms in
self-defence, for it might seem as if the King thus took on himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> the guilt of having caused the war: but he
was told that the words of a preamble were of no legal force, but a
mere form of reconciliation, and he determined not to break off on
this point. He only made it a condition, in order to avoid injurious
conclusions, that no single article was to have any validity till the
whole treaty was completed; and vigorously as the Independents in the
Lower House opposed the acceptance of this condition, they were not at
that time (Sept. 26) strong enough to hinder it.</p>

<p>The second article, whereby the military power, stronger and more
extensive than the King had himself ever possessed—for it included
Ireland and the Channel Islands—was surrendered to Parliament for
twenty years, he accepted now, many as were the objections which he
might have felt. His personal motive was very much the same as that
which induced the Scots to make their concessions to Parliament. He
calculated on removing through the restoration of peace the causes
which induced the nation to bear the pressure of so strong a standing
force. It had swelled like a flood during the tumult of the strife:
might it not return into its old channels when the weather changed?
What the storms of resistance could not achieve might be accomplished
perhaps by the sunshine of friendly concession.</p>

<p>Every day the hostile influence of the Independents grew stronger; and
in order to make peace possible in spite of them Charles gave way on
most of the other points. He surrendered to Parliament the nomination
to the most important offices for twenty years, recognised all the
orders issued by it under the Great Seal, abandoned his own, and
consented that the moneys requisite for satisfying the State creditors
should be raised in case of necessity without his co-operation. With
respect to the punishments which Parliament desired, he made at last
only a few exceptions, which did not touch the principle: he granted to
the city of London the right of nominating the Governor of the Tower,
and definitely renounced his feudal rights as represented by the Court
of Wards.</p>

<p>Nevertheless all would have broken down, and the evil consequences
would have been imputed to the King, had he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span>
not shown some compliance also in relation to the clergy and their
property. In the capital, which was favourable to him, an address was
carried praying for the payment of the Presbyterian clergy out of the
goods of the chapters. The King at last prevailed on himself to assent
to an alienation, though only temporary, of the Church property<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>.
He only insisted that it should be revocable by the ordinary legal
forms, and that the lawful incumbents should be cared for: the
bishops were to be suspended, not abolished, and the introduction of
Presbyterianism to have validity only for three years: as to accepting
the Covenant, he was as steadfast as ever in refusing this.</p>

<p>The treaty thus completed contained a compromise between the old
Newcastle propositions and the proposals suggested in the King’s
answer to them. It seems to have more importance than has ever
yet been attributed to it. It deserves notice as being the final
result of the negotiations so long carried on between the King and
Parliament: and it is well worth while to discuss the prospects
opened by it. The substance of it is that the Scottish system would
have been established, but in a more moderate form, and free from the
special provincial tendencies of the Scots. Parliament would have
been preponderant over the crown for a long term of years, but the
monarchy itself would have been preserved. That the King’s person
was inviolable was throughout these negotiations the assumption on
which the Grandees based their demand for security to themselves, as
they were not in this position<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>. As against the Independent views
it would probably have again taken root in men’s minds. And there
is scarcely room to doubt that the army, as was expected, must have
been overthrown had it come to carrying out this treaty. Moreover the
Presbyterian Church would have attained not to exclusive dominion,
but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> to a safe position: for public opinion
could scarcely in the course of three years have undergone such a
change as to bring about its annihilation. The episcopate would not
have been destroyed, but would have lost its political importance by
its exclusion from the House of Lords: it would not have raised itself
very high above the Presbytery<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>. England would have approached much
more nearly to the Protestant forms of the Continent, and would have
lost somewhat of its stiff peculiarity, but have gained in influence on
ecclesiastical movements, especially in France. It would have been a
different England, without any marked preponderance of the aristocracy,
thoroughly Protestant, but conservative in regard to the throne, less
exclusive and egotistical in its relations with the outside world, the
champion in every way of the other Teutonic races and nations. The
continuity of law would never have suffered any real interruption.</p>

<p>The majority of Parliament was for the treaty. In the debate upon it
the Lower House resolved not indeed that they would accept it, for
matters were not yet ripe for this step, but that the House found in
the King’s declarations a basis for proceeding to the restoration of
peace in the country<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>. The Upper House unanimously voted the same.
The capital manifested the liveliest desire to see the King once more
in the midst of it, for the completion of the negotiations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the army had developed totally opposite views. After
holding back for a short time it returned to the exhibition of its
ultra-religious and anti-monarchical tendencies in all their vehemence.
Already in his despatch after Preston, Cromwell had said that the
hand of God was in it all, that the people was as the apple of God’s
eye, while He rejected kings, and that they must now take courage and
destroy out of the land those who troubled it; then would God be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> glorified and the land have His blessing—words
deemed dark, which yet are clear. At the beginning of the campaign
the officers had opposed the agitation which was recommencing in the
army, but gradually they let it take its course. The regiments in
which originally it had its chief seat issued urgent addresses for
the limitation of the duration of Parliament, and for the punishment
of those who had taken part in the last troubles: they demanded the
thorough execution of justice upon all, common people, lords, even
the King, who must clear himself of the charge of having caused
innocent blood to be shed. The officers perceived that at the Newport
negotiations the plan had been formed of opposing to them a compact and
tenacious alliance. After some hesitation the general council of the
army joined the leading regiments in a great remonstrance, which bore
the name of the Generals, in which all accommodation with the King was
rejected<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>. For under whatever conditions he might be restored, he
would always exercise influence over Parliament, and perhaps even in
that now sitting win a preponderant party to his side. In the future
also, unless a system of election were introduced entirely free from
all crown influence, there would be corrupted Parliaments and the
fear of a return to absolute power. Parliament was urged to renew the
resolutions passed at the beginning of the year, which it had then been
understood would lead to the trial of the King: the public weal was the
highest law; and who had shown himself so hostile to it as the King?
The arguments by which the execution of Strafford had been justified
were now repeated. There were cases for which existing legislation had
not sufficiently provided: in such cases the supreme council of the
nation had authority to proceed.</p>

<p>The Parliament had still spirit enough to leave the remonstrance
unnoticed, and to continue the negotiations with the King<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>.
But the army was only the more excited.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1648.</span> It
observed that the King persisted in refusing much on which, after
former engagements, Parliament might have insisted: and this fact it
regarded as proof of an intention to oppose the army, and perhaps to
begin a new war, like the last, in league with the King. The first
idea was to cause a new breach in Parliament, and use this as occasion
for proceedings similar to those of two years before: but this was
rejected, as it seemed too dangerous to leave their adversaries in
possession of power, if only for a day or two. Or again, they thought
of inducing the minority to make a solemn protest against the majority:
but this step, as we know, lay outside the ideas and precedents of the
English House of Commons. At last the conviction prevailed that the
army, which did not consist of mercenaries, had not only the right, but
the duty, even without any forms of this kind, to avert the evil which
it saw coming. With the modern idea that kings were bound to govern
according to laws approved by the people, was united the doctrine,
derived from the records of the remotest antiquity, that the country in
which innocent blood had been shed could only be purified by the blood
of him who had shed it: as now the King had incurred the chief guilt
of the blood shed in England, the country, if it restored him to his
power, would draw down upon it the vengeance of God<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>. In a meeting
of officers of the army and Independent members of Parliament it was
agreed not to endure a state of things which gave occasion for fearing
so great an evil. They would have felt themselves fully justified in
taking the government directly into their own hands: but as yet they
could not do without the authority of Parliament, and moreover some of
its principal leaders were in league with them. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1648.</span> resolution was ultimately to change the majority in the Lower
House: and at a council of a few chiefs the names were settled of those
who were to be excluded.</p>

<p>Everything was already prepared for the execution of these projects.
The army, under the pretext of wishing to insure the payment of its
arrears, had advanced to the capital, and occupied the positions in the
suburbs most important from the military point of view, leaving the
city militia to fulfil its duties in Westminster only. Meanwhile the
King had been removed from the Isle of Wight, whence he might perhaps
have escaped or been carried off to London, to the gloomy and solitary
rock of Hurst Castle on the coast of Hampshire, where he was kept in
safe custody. The army was already dominant over the two powers, the
Royal and Parliamentary, which were trying to unite in opposition to it.</p>

<p>On December 4, 1648, the Parliament had still courage to protest
against the removal of the King from the island, as having taken place
without the assent of Parliament. On the 5th, as has been mentioned,
it declared the King’s answers sufficient to form a basis on which
to negotiate for the restoration of peace, and that the conference
should be with the King in person: General Fairfax was requested to
take steps for the conveyance of the King to London. The Lower House
still reckoned on the authority of the Parliamentary majority by which
everything had been done hitherto: it could not yet believe that any
personal injury could be inflicted on a born king after he had made
the greatest concessions possible to him, but still thought to advance
in the course of developing its ancient rights, when suddenly it was
recklessly checked by the power of the sword.</p>

<p>On the 6th of December the members, who saw themselves threatened, but
were still conscious of their former strength and importance, repaired
to St. Stephen’s Chapel, with the intention of causing the King to
be brought to London for the opening of definite peace negotiations.
When they arrived they found no longer the guard of city militia:
picquets of the army had occupied Westminster early in the morning
and had driven off the militia. As the Presbyterian members ascended
the stairs, or entered the antechamber, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1648.</span> arrested. They asked by whose orders, and under what commission
this was done, for they still thought that a valid order could proceed
only from themselves, and must be based on parliamentary resolutions.
Like Joyce at Holmby, Colonel Pride, who was on duty at Westminster,
pointed to the line of soldiers with drawn swords and lighted matches.
The House when it assembled sent its sergeants to summon back into the
chamber the members who were detained in the adjoining Queen’s court:
the result was that next day those who had prompted this step were also
arrested.</p>

<p>The number of members excluded was reckoned at ninety-six, those
arrested at forty-seven: only those were allowed to take any further
part in the sittings who signed a protest against the vote of December
5, of whom there were about eighty<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>. But in spite of this scanty
number they proceeded to act as though they formed the true Parliament.
They carefully revoked all that had been done in opposition to the
resolutions passed at the beginning of the year, so that these latter
regained their full force. This was a far more violent proceeding than
that of two years before. Then the army had reinstated at their own
request the members who had fled in consequence of tumultuous scenes;
now it had no pretence of a legal justification.</p>

<p>This was the time at which the elections for renewing the Common
Council took place in the city: and doubtless, had they been free,
they would have given results favourable to the King and to peace. The
transformed Parliament ordered that no one should be admitted therein,
or hold any city office, who had favoured the Scottish invasion, or
had shared in the tumults which had taken place during the last year
in London and its neighbourhood. Neither among the city authorities
nor in Parliament was any man to be endured who did not recognise the
authority of the army, or who might oppose its interests.</p>

<p>On December 9/19 some regiments of horse and foot again entered London.
They imposed heavy contributions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span> arrested
the suspected and their opponents<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>, but otherwise maintained strict
discipline. The city was bridled, the Lower House transformed into a
mere instrument of the army: it could now proceed to do what had long
been intended, and bring the King to legal trial as the great criminal.</p>

<p>Even as the prisoner of the army Charles I, since it had broken with
him, had twice become dangerous to it, once through his treaty with
the Scots, and again through his pacific dealings with Parliament.
He was so still at this moment: so long as he lived the Independent
leaders, who had laid violent hands on him, felt their own existence
threatened by his. They thought that they must either condemn the King,
or themselves be accounted guilty<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>. Moreover his condemnation would
imply the complete victory and sanctioning of their principles.</p>

<p>In the present state of the Lower House there was no difficulty about
carrying through the impeachment. The King was therein designated as
Charles Stuart, at present King of England. He was first charged with
the same crime for which Strafford had been condemned, namely with
having sought to overthrow the ancient liberties and fundamental laws
of the nation, and to introduce a tyrannical and arbitrary government.
The second and chief accusation was that he had caused civil war,
and filled the country with rapine and bloodshed. His punishment was
demanded chiefly that henceforth no magistrate might hope to remain
unpunished, if he tried to bring the English nation to bondage or to
any other form of ruin. The draft was accepted in the Lower House on
January 1, 1649, and the next day was sent to the Lords.</p>

<p>They had assembled in greater numbers than usual: as a rule there were
not more than four of them, now there were twelve, and their opposition
was unanimous. Lord Manchester declared it inconceivable that the King
should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span> be accused of high treason against
Parliament, for Parliament consisted of King, Lords, and Commons, and
there could be none without the King. Lord Northumberland remarked that
nineteen twentieths of the inhabitants of the country were doubtful
which of the two parties had begun the war, and that there was no law
to meet the case; it would be unreasonable to proceed where the facts
were doubtful, and even if they were certain no law was applicable.
Then the proposal for erecting a court of justice to try the King came
on for discussion. Denbigh, the Speaker of the House, who found his
name among those who had been designated as members of this court,
declared at this point that he would rather let himself be torn in
pieces than take part in so abominable a thing. The two drafts were
unanimously rejected, and the House adjourned for a week, that it might
not be further troubled with the matter immediately.</p>

<p>As the House of Lords thus refused its co-operation, so that no vote of
the two Houses of Parliament was to be expected, on what ground of even
colourable legality could any further proceedings rest? In the earlier
conflicts the idea had been mooted that the Lower House represented the
nation, and might go its way without the Lords; but this had never yet
happened. The view too that Parliament of itself possessed the supreme
power, though it had now and then been expressed, had as yet found no
approval in Parliament itself. It had based the authority which it
exercised on the fiction that the King’s will was virtually contained
in the resolutions of the two Houses. Now however no further use could
be made of this, and a principle was wanted, which should dispense
with all reference to King or Lords: the idea they adopted was that of
national sovereignty, and of its being represented by the Commons.</p>

<p>On January 4 the Lower House formed itself into a Committee to draw
up resolutions stating the extent of its rights. For this purpose
it laid down three main principles, that the source of all power,
under God, was in the people; that the supreme power belonged to the
Commons, as having been elected by the people and representing it;
and that what they declared to be law was so, even without the assent
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span> King and the Lords. After the House
had resumed, these principles were recognised by one member after
another<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>. It was in itself an event of incalculable importance
that an idea originating in the realm of philosophic abstractions,
after having been adopted by a strong faction possessing the power of
the sword, thus obtained acceptance in the ruling constitutional body
of a great nation. No single political idea in the course of the last
few centuries has exercised an influence at all comparable to that of
the sovereignty of the people. Repressed at times, and influencing
only opinions, and then breaking out again, often recognised, but
never realised, and always making its way, it has furnished the ever
active leaven of the modern world. The Scots had thought to unite
the sovereignty of the people with monarchy by divine right: but the
Independents opposed the latter with vigour. The idea of popular
sovereignty was adopted in its full strength, but at the same time,
it must be owned, in a form which contradicted its substance. The
theoretical maintenance of the fullest rights of popular independence
was coupled with practical subjection to military power.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords, in the absence of Manchester and Northumberland,
a proposal was made by way of compromise for a lawful resolution, by
which it should for the future be accounted high treason if a King
levied war against the Parliament and realm of England<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>: in such a
case he should be tried before Parliament. The difference is obvious,
as thereby the old constitution, and also the safety of the King, would
have been secured. But on the grounds of the principle once adopted and
recognised as valid, before which all formal legality vanished, the
Lower House as then constituted deemed itself justified in proceeding
on its course. It resolved that the ordinance rejected by the Lords
for erecting a tribunal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span> judge the King
should be issued in the usual forms of English procedure. Accordingly
the Commission already named assembled and appointed a high court
of justice, the members of which were immediately nominated. A far
greater number, originally 150, had been intended, but not more than
sixty or seventy actually met, only four of them being lawyers, one
of whom, John Bradshaw, was chosen president: the rest were generals
and colonels in the army, members of Parliament, country gentlemen,
aldermen, and citizens of London, and some lords, like Thomas Lord Grey
of Groby, adherents of the army and its ideas. All was prepared for its
sittings to begin in Westminster Hall on January 20.</p>

<p>Charles I might probably still have escaped the night before he was
removed from Newport (November 29). His attendants represented to him
that it was now no less necessary, and quite as possible, for him to
fly as when he was at Hampton Court. But the Parliament at the opening
of the conferences had not only taken precautions which made success at
least doubtful, but had also obtained from him a promise not to quit
the island during the conferences or for twenty days afterwards. He
was told in vain that the state of things had altered, since it was no
longer Parliament, but the army, that governed. Although this Prince,
so long as he was free, was fond of dealing with different parties on
contrary principles, yet when he had once given his word he deemed
himself irrevocably bound by it. When the question was pressed upon
him, he answered by a flat refusal. ‘They have made a promise to me,
and I to them; I will not be the first to break mine<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>.’ Charles I
had scarcely an apprehension that the views of the Agitators, before
which he had fled from Hampton Court, were now shared by the officers
who had once prevailed over them. But the disrespectful violence with
which he was carried off, at the moment when he was expecting peace,
made a crushing impression upon him. When his friends gathered round
him to kiss his hand at his departure, they saw for the first time
clouds on his brow and melancholy in his demeanour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span>

<p>At Hurst Castle the fear seized him that he should be murdered there.
It was more a blockhouse than a castle, having been built by Henry
VIII for the defence of the coast, on a tongue of land projecting into
the sea, with the waves beating round it on all sides but one, with
narrow, dark, and prison-like rooms. No good was presaged on seeing
the governor, a man of stern looks, long thick black hair and beard, a
huge sword by his side, and a partisan in his hand. The King had been
before warned against Major Harrison, as a man quite capable of putting
him to death. When in the night the drawbridge was heard to fall, and
it was announced that Major Harrison had just arrived, the King really
thought that this man was going to murder him, as some of his ancestors
had been secretly and treacherously slain: the place seemed to him just
suited for such an act. Harrison however was very far from harbouring
the thought ascribed to him: he came to bring the King the acceptable
tidings that he was to be removed from the worst to the best of his
castles, that of Windsor.</p>

<p>On the way he was greeted at Winchester by a portion of the gentry with
the old respect; at Windsor he felt almost at home again; his former
apartments had been prepared for him, and he was served at table, for
instance, with the ancient ceremony, the cup-bearer presenting him the
cup on his knee: a walk on the beautiful terrace was naturally far more
pleasant than his view at Hurst Castle over the lonely sea. Now for
the first time he heard what had taken place in Parliament, and that
the party which had been negotiating with him was ruined. He began to
be afraid that they would deprive him of the government: he thought
that they would offer the throne to his son, and confine him in some
fortress, perhaps the Tower: of this he was convinced. When informed
that he was to be brought to London, he exclaimed ‘God is everywhere.’</p>

<p>It was not a long imprisonment, nor secret murder that awaited him,
but what no one had expected, a formal trial in the full glare of
publicity. At St. James’s, whither he was at once conducted, the forms
of homage with which he was accustomed to be served were finally
dropped: and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span> January 20 he was brought
before the tribunal which was to pronounce sentence of life or death
on him. There was much suspense as to whether he would recognise the
tribunal and answer to the accusation. The Independents intimated that,
if he defended himself, fourteen days would be necessary for his trial,
but that, if he refused, the end would be reached in four days<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>.</p>

<p>The members of the court kept on their hats when the King entered
Westminster Hall, conducted by Colonel Tomlinson and an armed escort:
he too did not uncover his head. They did not recognise him as their
king, nor he them as his judges. At the first words of the indictment,
which said that the supreme power had been entrusted to him by the
people, he interrupted the clerk who was reading it with the remark
that he possessed the royal power by hereditary right, it had not been
entrusted to him (by men): the violent expressions which followed, in
which he was described as a traitor, a murderer, and a public enemy, he
received with ironical laughter. Then the Lord President requested him
to answer to the indictment; in reply, he asked first to be informed by
what lawful authority he was here tried: he would submit to any such,
but to recognise an unlawful authority would be to violate the duty he
owed to God. Further than this he could not be induced to go. As his
went away his eyes fell on the sword which lay on the table: he said
that he was not afraid of it<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>.</p>

<p>The next sitting, on January 22, is not without interest
controversially. At a meeting of the judicial commission with the Lower
House it had been decided that the King could not be allowed to call
in question its legality, even conditionally: the sitting was opened
with a declaration that the court had weighed the objection made by the
accused, but had convinced itself that its competence, being founded
on the authority of the Commons of England, admitted of no doubt. The
King was astonished at their giving him no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span>
reasons, and went on further to develope his own. He said that he had
been defending not his own cause only, but had been standing up for
the rights of the people: for if a power raised itself up without
law, and wanted to make laws and to upset the fundamental laws of the
realm, who in the country would be secure of his life or could call
anything his own? The President interrupted him with the remark that
the court sat there in the name of the Commons of England, to whom the
King was answerable, like his forefathers. The King rose and said that
he desired that any precedent could be shown him, for the Commons of
England had never been a court of justice. He was not allowed to say
any more: when he was again alone, he wrote down what he had intended
to say. It was mainly that that procedure only could be lawful which
was by the law of God, or by the law of the land. No one would maintain
that the former allowed any proceedings against the King, for the
Scripture said that where the word of a king was, there was power, and
no man could say to him What doest thou? Nor could the King be tried
according to English law, for every indictment ran in his name, and
the old principle was that the King could do no wrong. Charles I, in
maintaining his superiority in opposition to the supposed commission
of the people, which moreover had never been asked for<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>, returns
always to the necessity for laws and a government to protect life
and property. But what was the case then? how had the two Houses of
Parliament been treated? The Upper House had been thrust aside, and
most part of the Lower excluded from the sittings by force or terror.
What would be the result if a power, governing without order or law,
sought to overturn the old form of the constitution under which England
had flourished for centuries? He had been brought there against his
will, but he was defending along with his own rights the liberty of the
people also.</p>

<p>It is not stated in the protocols, but a member of the court has
related, that the King’s appeal to his divine right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D.
1649.</span> was met by a similar claim on behalf of the Commons. He and the
people had appealed to the sword, which had decided in favour of the
people: but the people would not hold the sword in vain, but sought
expiation for the blood that had been shed. It might have been in
reference to this that the King added, that he had taken up arms to
maintain the fundamental laws of the realm.</p>

<p>The question in this trial is not strictly one of legal procedure. It
brings to light the opposition of the two powers which move the world,
the inherited, historically formed power, interwoven with existing
laws and prevailing social ideas, and that which ascribes to the
representation of the people, even though, as in this case, highly
imperfect, an unlimited authority before which all historical rights
vanish. The idea of the sovereignty of the people and the divine right
of kings enter as it were into a bodily struggle with each other.</p>

<p>It almost seems as if Charles I had felt tempted to answer, for he
spoke readily and in these days well<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>: it seemed to him easy to
rebut the accusation in single points, and to bring his innocence to
light; but this would have constituted a recognition of the tribunal,
which he would never allow to be laid to his charge: he would have
deemed it to be sanctioning illegality, and sacrificing the rights and
dignity of his crown.</p>

<p>The tradition goes that at this juncture offers were once more made
to him by the army: he was promised that his life should be spared,
that he should even retain the crown, if he would agree that the army
should remain as an independent body under the officers which it then
had, or which the council of war should name, and be empowered itself
to collect, by the aid of an extensive martial law, the land-tax to be
devoted to its pay. Charles I is said to have answered that he would
not subject his people to the arbitrary power of an armed faction: he
would sacrifice himself for his people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span>

<p>At the request of the Prince of Wales the States-General sent an
extraordinary embassy to intercede for the King’s life; but the Lower
House did not think proper to give them an audience. Queen Henrietta
prayed for leave to come back and be with her husband: the contents of
her letter were known, but Parliament set it aside unopened. The French
ambassador did not venture to interfere: he was afraid that it would
not only avail nothing, but irritate them against France; for there
was already a talk of aiding the insurrection which had broken out in
Paris<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>. At last Mazarin determined to send De Varennes to London
as ambassador-extraordinary, warning him at the same time that he must
avoid injuring the interests of France by his intervention on behalf of
Charles I; but De Varennes had not gone further than Boulogne before
all was over in London.</p>

<p>At St. James’s Charles I seems to have cherished the belief that his
life would not be touched, because, according to ancient usage, his
death would totally destroy the legal rights of Parliament: but the
theory already adopted had made this custom meaningless.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the King’s protestations, or by any considerations of
this kind, the court, after some evidence had been taken, resolved, on
the sixth day of the proceedings, January 25, to condemn the King to
death as a tyrant, a traitor, a murderer, and a public enemy of the
commonwealth of England. Two days later the sentence was to be made
known to the prisoner. The King then asked for one more hearing before
the two Houses; not that he would have had any special proposition to
make, but that he wanted an audience before whom to speak his mind. The
President remarked that this amounted to the King’s wishing to speak to
the members of the court without acknowledging its authority. Without
further delay the sentence was read, by which Charles Stuart was
condemned to death for his treasons and crimes. Charles again tried to
speak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span> but was prevented with insulting haste.
‘They cannot endure’ he said, ‘that their King should speak to them:
what justice have others to expect at their hands?’</p>

<p>Life was over: after preparing himself, with the assistance of Bishop
Juxon and by receiving the Sacrament, to appear before God, and
give account to Him to whom alone he felt that he was answerable,
he had only one royal and fatherly duty to perform: he sent for his
two children who were at hand (they were living at Sion House), his
daughter Elizabeth, aged thirteen, and his youngest son Henry of
Gloucester, who numbered nine years. He told the boy that the army
intended, it was reported, to make him King, but that he had two
elder brothers, and would endanger his soul and forfeit his father’s
blessing, if he accepted the crown. He begged his daughter not to
grieve on his account, for it was a glorious death that he was to
suffer, he was dying for the laws and liberties of his country, and
for the true Protestant religion. He advised her to read Laud’s book
against Fisher to strengthen her in this faith. He advised her and her
sisters to obey their mother, his son James to reverence his elder
brother as his King. That this latter would ascend the throne was to
him beyond all doubt. Then, said he, they would all be happier than
if he had remained alive (he meant under the conditions which he had
accepted at Newport): he had forgiven all his enemies, and his children
might do the same; but they must never trust them, for they had been
false to him and, as he feared, to their own souls. He added withal
that he died as a martyr.</p>

<p>He had often expressed the wish once more to meet the people of his
capital, who had again inclined in his favour: it was granted to him
on the scaffold. This was erected at Whitehall, on the spot where
the kings were wont to show themselves to the people after their
coronation. Standing beside the block at which he was to die, he was
allowed once more to speak in public. He said that the war and its
horrors were unjustly laid to his charge; the guilt was with those
who had robbed him of his lawful authority over the armed forces. Yet
God’s judgments were just, for an unrighteous sentence which he had
once permitted was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span> <span class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1649.</span> avenged by a
like sentence on himself. If at last he had been willing to give way
to arbitrary power and the change of the laws by the sword, he would
not have been in this position: he was dying as the martyr of the
people, passing from a perishable kingdom (the phrase is his own) to an
imperishable. On the suggestion of the bishop he again declared that
he died in the faith of the Church of England, as he had received it
from his father. Then bending to the block, he himself gave the sign
for the axe to fall upon his neck. A moment, and the severed head was
shown to the people, with the words—‘This is the head of a traitor.’
All public places, the street-crossings, and especially the entrances
of the city, were occupied by soldiery on foot and on horseback. An
incalculable multitude had however streamed to the spot. Of the King’s
words they heard nothing, but they were aware of their purport through
the cautious and guarded yet positive language of their preachers.
When they saw the severed head, they broke into a cry, universal and
involuntary, in which the feelings of guilt and weakness were blended
with terror—a sort of voice of nature, whose terrible impression those
who heard it were never able to shake off.</p>

<p>To some it will appear scarcely allowable, in the light of our times,
to revert to the question how far the words repeatedly uttered by
Charles I in the solemn moments between this life and eternity, that
he died as a martyr, really expressed a truth. Certainly not so in the
sense that has been attached to them, that he was merely a sufferer who
lived and bled for the known truth. He was rather a prince who all his
life long fought for his own rights and power, which he, if ever man
did, personally exercised, seeking at first to extend, and later only
to defend them, by all means in his power, open and secret, in council
and in the field, in the battle of words and with actual weapons, and
who perished in the conflict.</p>

<p>Let us figure to ourselves the characteristics of the several epochs
of his government. For the nature of a man does not appear at once:
it is rather in the separate phases of his life that his real self
is developed, and the attributes which compose his character are
exhibited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span>

<p>In the first stage of his public life Charles I, like most princes
on their accession, seems to have felt a certain wish to be popular.
Filled with personal antipathy to Spain, he rejected, even in his
father’s lifetime, his system of foreign and domestic policy,
which certainly gave occasion for some blame, but was universally
circumspect. After he had ascended the throne he followed the same
course, but then he discovered the strength of the forces which he had
undertaken to resist, and the untrustworthiness of the elements on
which he relied for support. In foreign affairs, especially German, he
rather increased the evils and complications: we find him at war with
the two great powers, between which his father had sought to steer: but
at last he contented himself with a neutral position, after concluding
peace with them both. In domestic politics the popular principles
which he had at least partially recognised and then sought to prevent
from attaining general acceptance, arrived at a full consciousness of
their strength: the King stooped to neutralise by secret protests the
concessions which he could not publicly refuse to them. In all things
he appears never self-reliant, rather enterprising and active than
of steadfast strength; justified in his own eyes, but not before the
world, which above all things desires firmness and success.</p>

<p>There followed a period of tranquillity at home and peace abroad. The
King turned his activity to commercial enterprise, and occupied his
intellect with literature and art, in which he found endless delight.
Intellectual conversation appeared to him the greatest of all pleasures
which man can enjoy. His wife afforded him this through her attendants
as well as herself, and it was for this that he first valued her. At
the same time he came back to the idea of completing his father’s
system, of subjecting the three kingdoms to ecclesiastical uniformity,
and extending the royal prerogative so far that no parliamentary claims
should have a chance of shaking it. He appears dignified, tranquil,
polished, but inclined to violent repression and systematic coercion.</p>

<p>Then the storm broke upon him, with a universal movement of
disobedience and resistance. After some violent efforts which were
unsuccessful, at sight of the general desertion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span> <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1649.</span>
the King was impressed with a feeling that he had gone too far. To a
harsh stubbornness, which seemed incapable of being shaken, succeeded
a compliance even disgraceful. The men who had most powerfully
represented the royal ideas were abandoned, and concessions never to
be revoked were granted to their opponents. All seemed to depend on
satisfying their claims, so as to establish an equilibrium between
prerogative and parliamentary rights, when at last he discovered that
this was impossible. The great current of European affairs, which had
taken a turn in favour of purely Protestant ideas, aided his opponents,
who had before all things adopted these opinions. When Charles I
prepared to resist them, he caused the full development of the hostile
powers, and saw himself reduced to the necessity of abandoning his
capital to them. This was for him a period of manifold errors, of false
and deceitful policy, of secret agony.</p>

<p>When now the inalienable rights of the crown, and not only the
political influence, but the status and possessions of the Episcopal
Church were attacked, the King’s innate antipathy to the demands
made on him revived in all its strength. Free from the accidental
and changeful influence of the capital, in the air of the distant
counties where the old notions of the monarchy still had life, under
the influence of his wife, who though insulted and a fugitive was still
active from a distance, he resolved to take up arms. Then he showed
himself courageous, warlike, not without strategical talents: he had
successes which gave a hope of the restoration of his authority. But
his enemies not only gathered foreign forces against him, but developed
in their midst a fanatical and also military faction, which went far
beyond their original tendencies. The King did not hesitate to oppose
both with a zeal which far exceeded his real strength. By his orders
the battle of Marston Moor was fought: he himself decided at Naseby not
to wait for the attack of the enemy, but to advance against them. Thus
he failed in the field, and the defeat scattered his adherents.</p>

<p>James I had probably during his lifetime too high an idea of the
strength of his opponents; Charles I certainly had too slight a
one: just as at the beginning, when he provoked war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span> <span class="sidenote">
A.D. 1649.</span> with Spain, so at the time when he sought to impose his
ecclesiastical laws on the Scots—undertakings from which all his
difficulties proceeded—he knew neither the depth of the lawful desires
of Parliament, nor the purport of the opposition already begun: he
cherished splendid hopes when nearest to his ruin. For he trusted
chiefly to the intrinsic power of the rights and ideas for which he
fought. Though imprudent in his undertakings, he was at bottom of solid
understanding: often undecided and untrustworthy—we know how fond he
was of having two strings to his bow—he never lost sight of the high
importance of his cause: he was naturally inclined to concessions,
but neither the threats of his enemies nor the entreaties of his
confidants could induce him to cross the line which he had marked out
with sagacity and conscientiousness, in religion and politics: he held
immoveably the convictions on which depended the connexion between the
crown and the established Church. In misfortune he appears not without
moral greatness. It would have been easy for him to save his life, had
he conceded to the Scots the exclusive domination of Presbyterianism
in England, or to the Independents the practical freedom of the
army, as they themselves desired. That he did not do so is his merit
towards England. Had he given his word to dissolve the episcopal
government of the Church, and to alienate its property for ever, it is
impossible to see how it could ever have been restored. Had he granted
such a position to the army as was asked in the four articles, the
self-government of the corporations and of the commons, and the later
parliamentary government itself, would have become impossible. So far
the resistance which he offered cannot be estimated highly enough. The
overthrow of the constitution, which the Independents openly intended,
made him fully conscious, perhaps not of their ultimate intention, the
establishment of a republic, but certainly of his own position. So far
there was certainly something of a martyr in him, if the man can be
so called who values his own life less than the cause for which he is
fighting, and in perishing himself, saves it for the future.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
